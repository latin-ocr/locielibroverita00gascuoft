resident rectors and dignitaries lingered (p. 198) as they did at Paris,
though few, perhaps, were such scandalous persons as the pluralist and
lay archdeacon, the idiot Birmingham. Gascoigne tells two stories
(pp. 188, 222) of Oxford clergymen, which prove that the vices of the
University had extended to the parish priests, if they were not en-
couraged by them, and of a friar minor (p. 139) who openly excused
incontinence in a sermon, but was excommunicated afterwards.

Henry the Fifth, we are told (p. 218), intended to reform the Uni-
versity of Oxford and its statutes‚ ‘the mere work of young men,
by providing that the regents should not hereafter dispense with any
University statute, and further said that he purposed founding a college
of theologians and artists (i.e. secular students in arts) within the Castle
of Oxford, and annex to this college all the alien priories, and the Pope
agreed to this plan, but he was prevented by death. His son Henry VI,
in his youth, gave these priories to the college of Eton near Windsor, and
the college of St. Nicholas at Cambridge, i.e. King’s.’ The same resources
availed for the great foundation of Sion Abbey and Nunnery at Sheen.
Henry VI founded Eton and King's on the model of Winchester and
New Colleges. He even came down to Osney Abbey near Oxford, and
heard the service performed there by the choir of New College (I found the
items of the expense to which New College was put for the service in
the annual account), but for some reason or other, he took a dislike to
Oxford, and tried to persuade Waynflete, we are told, to transfer his
intended benefaction to Cambridge.

Apart from the general corruption, cowardice (p. 38), and sophistry
(p. 200) which prevailed in the University, the principal complaint which
Gascoigne makes against Oxford is the venality of the regents. They sell
graces and degrees sor money (pp. 3, 20, 208), they even sell the office of
Bedel. The most scandalous case, however (p. 24), was' that of a rector,
who was caught in adultery with the wife of one of his parishioner3‚ but
was disgracefully left in his cure by the bishop. ‘Yet,’ says Gascoigne,

‘Oxford afterwards admitted him as Doctor of D-egrees, and thereby ιζ· „

affronted numbers of people, and thus by an act of the bishop and an

act of Oxford, admitting good and bad to the highest academical degrees,
infinite mischief and bold sin follow?

The Universities gave the code os morality to the bishops and ,the
