xiv PREFACE.

The special value of these extracts from Gascoigne’s Manu-
script resides in the fact, that they are singularly illustrative of
the darkest period in the social and politica] history of England.
Other contemporary materials are, first, the Rolls of Parliament,
which have never been sufficiently examined; next, the dry
Chronicle of Wyrcestre; next, the pedantic dissertations of
Whetehamstede; and lastly, the Paston Letters. For the rest,
the student of history must rely on the narratives of the
Tudor annalists. In Gascoigne we have an estimate of English
society, made by a contemporary who had considerable op-
portunities for forming a judgment, and possessed sufficient
searlessness in dealing with men and facts. His words may
sometimes seem to be those of a disappointed man, often of
an angry man; but of his genuine piety, and sincere desire for
the reformation of society, there can be no doubt.

Other manuscripts of Gascoigne, and probably the original
of these volumes, were in the Cotton Library (Otho), and
perished when the house in Little Dean’s Yard, where the
library was placed, was consumed.
