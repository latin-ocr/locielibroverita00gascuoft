of London. This man, who was brother of the more celebrated mayor
of Bristol‚ to whom the magnificent church of St. Mary Redclifse was
due, and was a member of the Company of Grocers, with the Chicheles,
brothers of the Archbishop. All that is known of this letter is contained
in Gascoigne, who (pp. 212-13) mentions twice over that the Lord Mayor,
on reading it, and detecting in it very suspicious passageS‚ tending to
change of fidelity (for I interpret ‘fides' here to mean loyalty to the
king) and of insurrection in the realm of England, sent it on vto the king,
and that when the king and lords read it, they detected the same ten-
dencies‚ and that great scandal arose about the great lords in the realm,
who, he said in his letter, were on the side of him and his English books.
And he observes that all the temporal lords of the malm, who were with
Henry, demanded that he should be expelled from the king’s council
and that of the lords. This expulsion took place about St. Martin’s day
(Nov. 11), 1457, for no tempora] lord in the king’s council would state
his opinion and advice, or utter what he thought would be for the good
of the kingdom until Pecok was driven out of the council chamber.
Then Pecok was ordered to bring his books, nine in number, to the
archbishop, in order that they might be examined by such doctors as
the archbishop might appoint.

Pecok was degraded‚ his books burnt at Paul’s Cross, where,
Gascoigne says, the populace would have burnt him too if they could
have got at him, on Dec. 4. The same ceremony was performed at
Carfax in Oxford‚ by Chandler, Chancellor of the University and War-
den of New College, on Dec. 17. He had made his abjuration on Nov.
28 at Lambeth, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
other bishops, and many doctors of theology, two temporal lords, Lords
Stanley and De Scales, and many Knights. He was then committed to
Maidstone to await judgment. Pecok, we are informed‚ was ultimately
sent to the Monastery os Thorney, where a decent allowance was made
him, but where he was not to be allowed writing materials. He thence-
forth disappears from history. The particulars of his trial, as far as known,
are given in the edition os the ‘Repressor' published in the Rolls' Series.

I arn convinced that the ‘brawlers in the pulpits,’,as Pecok calls the
orthodox preachers, would have denounced his heresies in vain had he
not ruined himself by his letter to the Lord Mayor. I have already sug-
