bail ; and it is for these reasons that they are glad that the law is trans-
gressed. Now, they say, our gains grow, when men break the law, and
they rejoice in the worst acts for the villainous gain which comes to them
from the offences of others I heard a bachelor of law say ‘⁶ I wish there
were more criminals than there are, for then we lawyers should do well.'’
‚that is, he wished men to be evil-doers, that he might get his profit from
trials’ Thereupon Gascoigne tells a story of one Richworth, a bailiff of
Henry V, who bribed a man to create a disturbance in order that he
might make a good thing of it, and had his head broken, in satisfac-
tion of the bargain, by the man whom he had bribed.

In connection with this growth of litigation and chicanery, Gascoigne
states that latterly in England‚ about 1443, what he calls a falsa lex
was discovered, by which Ι suppose he means some precedent was estab-
lished in relation to entails. ⁶ If any person has an estate in tail limited
to himself and the lawful heirs of his body, and mortgages this estate to
another for a certain term, and the mortgage money be not paid on the
day appointed for payment, the estate tail will pass to the mortgagee as
an oetate in see simple, and the heir in remainder will be unjustly deprived
of his inheritance.’ And then he says‚—the passage is rather obscure,—
‘ Woe to him by whom the offence cometh, i.e. the origin of such a
mischief, that it may be possible to entail land, and that the lord of a fee
simple, which he himself has without condition, should give it on condition,
viz, that such and such persons should have the lands after him.⁷

The reader will find much more than Ι have commented on in these
extracts. My object in writing this long introduction has been to give
some account of the political and social condition of England in the first
half of the fifteenth century, and particularly during the period which
followed after the loss of the English possessions in F rance to the time of
Gascoigne's death. The greater part of these notes were made Ι believe
in the last eight years of Gascoigne's life. He lamented over the evils
which had alroedy come upon England, and he foresaw that greater evils
were in store for her. To the modern student not the least of these was
the wreck, for nearly two centurieS‚ of public liberty in parliamentary
institutions. Dark as the prospect was, unpromising as the materials were, '
some statesmen in the middle of the fifteenth century believed that they
could grapple with the difficulties of the situation. But their efforts were
