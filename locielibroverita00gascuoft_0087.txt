new monasteries, There were plenty of them in existence. Land was
very valuable‚ and the law very jealous of monasteries acquiring land.
There was, however, one way in which an active and ambitious man could
better his fortunes, or an ailing sinner could secure his forgiveness. This
was by robbing the parochia} clergy. -The lessee for a very long term on
a very beneficial holding of abbey lands, could make a good bargain with
the abbey; and a frightened offender could satisfy himself that he would
get the perpetual prayers of the monks‚ the value of which was not as
yet disputed, if either of them could assist the monks in turning rectories
into vicarages—that is, in securing the principal tithes to the monastery,
and arranging that the monks should provide the services of some vicar
who would undertake the cure of souls and the offices of the church sor
a very much smaller stipend than the income of the rectory. The vicar
need not preach3 the bishops thought this unimportant or dangerous3
there was very little to do, and many people were eager to take the priest's
office in those days, that they might eat a piece of bread, especially when
the war with France was no longer a profitable calling.

The appropriation of benefices to monasteries, colleges, capitular
dignities and collegiate churches began very early. The reasoning which
led to the practice was very natural. The monks of the older orders
were industrious and learned. They reclaimed wastes, improved agricul-
ture, and wrote books. Had it not been for the monasteries, every trace
of ancient learning would in all probability have vanished. Had it not
been for the monasteries, it is difficult to conceive how civilisation could
have revived after the aristocracy and caesarism of Rome had ruined
ancient culture3 for the barbarians, in destroying the remains of it, imi-
tated and perpetuated the hateful institutions which had wasted the
whole world. We should not even have known the history of our own
people if it had not been for the monks‚ for the chronicles of the abbeys
are the principal materials for the annals of England. In the days of
violence the abbeys were nearly the only refuge3 in the days of igno-
rance they were the only schools. Many a thriving English town owes
its existence to the fostering care of the monks. The two English
Universities seem to have grown up obscurely under the shadow of
ancient monasteries. ,It was obvious that these establishments should
be endowed with the most permanent source os revenue, a tax on agri·
