be excluded from the office os the preacher, but why should all be
suspended, and be exposed to the extortions or the caprices of the
diocesan? Man should not impose silence on all doctors and bishops
because several of both kinds are heretics. But: adds my author,
‘the judgment of God came on the archbishop. His throat was choked
so that he could neither swallow nor cough; and thus he, who by his
own tongue had stopped the word of God, had his tongue stopped
when he was anxious above all things to speak. The silencing of the
preachers was a matter to murmur at, having been done in order to
suspend a few heredes, but the bishops did not or could not preach
themselves, and were angry (p. 35) when men said “Such and such
a doctor preaches well, though no bishop, but our bishop neither can
nor will preach, and so one who is no bishop does more good than
a bishop does.'' ’

The corruption and pride of the fifteenth-century bishops is illus-
trated by two stories given in pp. 22—233 their extortion appears
everywhere, but is put in the most flagrant view in p. 123, where an
archbishop (undoubtedly Kemp, of York,) bids the curates of his diocese
exact sees from all penitents who come for absolution, in order that the
works of the cathedral of York may be finished.

The two stories are so characteristic that I am tempted to translate
them. ‘ Henry IV, King of England‚ asked Henry Bowet, Archbishop
of York, “What can be the reason why bishops in our time are not
‘translated’ (i. e. their bodies solemnly removed from their graveS‚
with a view to canonization), on account of famous miracles of theirs,
as was once the case?'’ The bishop was silent, and a clerk standing by
said, “Is you will, sir, that I should speak, I will mention what seem to me
to be the four causes of the fact.” The king gladly gave him leave.
‘⁶ One cause,” said the clerk‚ “ was, that once God showed by some special
sign who was worthier than other men by reason of his wisdom and
holy life to be made bishop, and thereupon God made miracles on behalf
of persons thus elected in their life and after their death. But now such
persons are chosen by earthly persons and by you kings to be bishops as
pleases you, and just the same miracles which you kings do, the bishops
nominated by you do also. Again, kings used to bow the knee, begging
holy and learned men to undertake episcopal duties‚ because these duties
