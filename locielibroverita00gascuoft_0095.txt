schools. Fleming had been a Wikliffite and was now a persecutor,
and was even founding a novelty in Oxford‚ a college of priests, whose
business it was to be to defend the Church, its institutions and its
doctrines, against innovators, a college whose destiny it was to be the
means of educating the Wesleys. There is nothing in the irony of
history which strikes one more, than the fact that a college which was
called into existence to defend the old ways, should have developed‚
as time went on, the most successful attack on Anglicanism, whether
it be that of the fifteenth or the seventeenth century.

Gascoigne tells us little about the colleges. He alludes to Balliol,
but only in connexion with his two friends, Thwaites and Grey3 to New
College, but only because the Warden happened to be Chancellor when
Pecok's books were burnt at Carfax3 to the libraries of Exeter and
Durham Cosseges, the latter of which fell with the monastery whose
novices it was founded to educate. He refers (p. 96) to a sermon of one
Holcot‚ who may have been the Warden of Merton‚ and lived in Oxford
during Gascoigne's residence, which is quoted to show that a man may
get a dispensatim, even from a Pope‚ and be damned for using it, but he
gives· the preacher neither Christian name nor place. The fact is, the
colleges in Oxford were at this time mere fragments in the University.
Some were wealthy‚ like Merton‚ New, and All S-ouls; but the resources
of these foundations were limited to the recipients of the benefaction, and
the rule of the founder was to put as many persons on the endowment as
the funds would bear. Resides, the fellow was always to be poor.
Chichele allowed no man to share his benefaction who had five pounds
a year income. The fellows of Merton‚ to judge from the furious quarrels
among them and the trivial causes of the quarrel, must have housed
together, and seen hardly any one else, like the Spanish monks in
Browning’s poem. The fellows of N ew College were often constrained
to go into religion, because they could hardly live. Those of the poorer
colleges, like University‚ Balliol, Oriel, Exeter‚ Queen's, and Lincoln, were
the recipients of small sfipends, derived from some tithes and some build-
ings, and eked out their scanty revenues by taking lodgers. Thus Wiklif
took lodgings in Queen'S, and was probably acceptable‚ because he was
then high in favour with the King and his son John of Gaunt, whose son,
afterwards Cardinal Beaufort, and grandson, afterwards Henry V, were
