A great export trade in barley was carried on between the Eastern
counties and the Flemish towns, which in return taught the Eastern
sarmers the use of hops as a means of flavouring and preserving malt
liquors‚ and established the distinction between ale, which was brewed
without hops, and beer which contained them. For it is remarkable
that during the whole of the sanguinary struggle between the rival
Houses, one reads nothing os devastations committed by either army,
except those of Margaret’s northern troops in the winter of 1460 and
the spring of 1461. The record of prices in England, especially those of
wheat and barley, gives no indication whatever that war produced scarcity.
During the whole of the fifteenth century, the harvest was a failure in only
one year, 1438-9. When the strife was at the hottest‚ bread and beer
were abundant and cheap, for the cost of a labourer's maintenance was
from 8d. to 9d. a week. In the reign of Elizabeth‚ contracts for the board
of the men in her employ were as high as 45. 6d. to 55. for the same time.

When the Parliament of 14 53 was prorogued‚ there were hopes that
Shrewsbury would re-conquer Guienne, and finally Normandy. But all
was lost on July 17, when the veteran and his son fell before the fortress
of Chatillon, and the English army was destroyed or captured. Soon
after, Bordeaux was invested and surrendered, and every hope of re-
covering the ancient dominions of the English Kings in France was
irrevocably gone. Calais and the forts near it alone remained, and the
efforts os the year, both military and financiaL had been wasted.

The news of these accumulated calamities, as is most probable,
brought about the insanity which affected the King at this time. He
had gone to Clarendon in Wilts, when he fell into a helpless melancholia,
accompanied by utter debility and insensibility. When his malady corn-
menced is not clearly stated. But if we can inser from Rymer, no state
paper was issued between july 27 and Dec. 3, 1453. His son was born on
Oct. 23, while he was unconscious of all that passed. He did not know
that this event had occurred, as we leam from the Paston letters, till Christ-
mas, 1454, when he recovered his reason as suddenly as he had lost it.

Public opinion had now completely veered round. The Parliament
which had met in high spirits, in a generous mood‚ and with a determin-
ation to make sacrifices forits foreign policy, which even acquiesced in the
administration of somerset, and accorded to him a temporary confidence‚
