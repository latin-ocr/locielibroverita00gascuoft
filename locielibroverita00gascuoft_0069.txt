was a man of learning, who might have held his own despite his sus·
picious theology, if he had not meddled with politics on his own
account. Nevil was a youth, who was not old enough to be con-
secrated, even by the most pliant of popes, to his see (p. 16), and yet
he felt himself able in Pecok’s humiliation to twit him (p. 213) with
his contempt for the holy doctorS. Ι cannot but think that there is
not a little sarcasm in Pecok's reply: ‘I regret that Ι wrote so, for Ι
did not look sufficiently to the circumstances?

Again‚ the events of these six years, compared with the earlier
days of the Long Parliament, and the earlier action of the Convention
Parliament‚ not to go later down, are confirmatory of the fact that
for centuries the solution os political difficulties has been manageable
by a well-ordered and patriotic Parliament. To my mind, the par-

parliamentary control. And I venture on saying that there is no
single principle of government and finance, no serious issue between
the administration and the nation, which was not, is one reads the
facts aright, present in the constitution which Fortescue lauded, and
Troeham and his sellows guarded. The experience os the fifteenth
century statesman was narr0w3 he had to create his precedents, and
to define his procedure, but he was resolved on maintaining the in-
stitutions which he had inherited. After the vices of the two most
powerful factors in the state, the Church and the nobility‚ made ruin
of those labours which would have given England a genuine Parliament‚
well sortified by needful privileges, and yet strong in that modest sels-

respect which assists men more than anything else to wise speech and

England went back two centuries, the successors of the fifteenth century

statesmen cherished their traditions, and in good time revived them for

opportune action. Τὴε arraignment of Suffolk by Tresham is as in-
