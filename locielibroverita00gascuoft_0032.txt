than a century the equipoise of the constitution, and gave the opportunity
for a despotism‚ which in the hands of Henry the Eighth so impoverished
England as to make it, till the time of Cromwell, a third-rate power in
Europe. The beginnings of the civil strife were witnessed, its causes
discovered, and its effects in some measure predicted by Gascoigne.
And though in his estimate of these causes, my author dwells almost
too exclusively on ecclesiastical abuses‚ it will not be difficult for us to
see that those abuses were at once an effect and a cause, and that the
greediness, selfishness, neglect of duty, and political perfidy which cha-
racterised the churchmen of the fifteenth century were possible in the
clergy by reason that they were even more rife and more scandalous in
the laity.

The war which Henry commenced was carried on vigorously by
John, Duke of Bedford, who was two years younger than the king.
There was only a year’s interval between each of the three younger sons,
Thomas, Duke of Clarence, having been born in 1388, and Humphrey of
Gloucester, the youngest of the four, in 1389. Thomas had been killed
at Beauge in 1421. The administration of home affairs was generally in
the hands of the younger brother, whose impetuous temper and rash
acts embroiled him with his uncle, the Bishop of Winchester. These
differences began as early as 1424, and lasted with little intermission till
the Protector’s suspicions death in 1446. Gascoigne tells us that it was
owing (p, 155) to the intrigues and deceits of Beaufort that Otho
Colonna (Martin V) was elected to the Papacy in 1417, instead of a better
man, at the Council of Constance, by certain cardinals and certain
deputies of the Council. The election os Martin V was the cause of
grave scandals in the Roman Court (p. 154), and might have caused
serious complications between England and the Papacy (p. 17) had
not the Pope's death occurred.

But a curse seemed to hang over the House of Lancaster. The three
sons of Henry the Fourth married and were childless‚ two of them, the
Dukes of Bedford and Gloucester, having married twice. In 1446 it
seemed that the family would become naturally extinct, unless issue
might be expected from the King and Queen who had been married in the
summer of 1445. But no child was born of this marriage for more than
eight years when the Queen gave birth on October 23, 1453, to Edward of
