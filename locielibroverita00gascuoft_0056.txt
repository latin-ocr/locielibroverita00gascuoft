were preachers in Gascoigne’s days, our author informs us, who denounced
the vices of the time. These were chiefly the London clergy‚ three of
whom, the Rectors of St. Andrew's, Holborn‚ and All Saints’, and the
Master of Whittington College, spoke out boldly. But James Say, Lord
F iennes, took care that the King should not hear what they said, ‘ for he
and others about the King would allow no one to preach before the
King unless the sermon were written and submitted to them, or unless
the preacher promised ori oath that he would not preach against the
King’s household, or against the King‘s doings, or against the doings of
his Privy‚ or to be more accurate, his depraved, Counci13 and so he un-
justly and unfairly, and they who sided with him, bound the Word of

Fiennes was one of the victims of Jack Cade's insurrection in June
1450. In the autumn of 1449, discontent with the governm'ent was
universal, and when the Commons met on Nov. 6, the popular opinion
pointed to Sufsolk as the cause of all the national calamities and national

domy but loss, the loss by cession of Maine and Anjou3 and again by
conquest or by treachery of Normandy and Guienne. He and those

Tresham‚ who had been Speaker in t'he Parliaments os 1439, 1442,
and 1447, and was one of the knights for Northamptonshire.

The air of Westminster was pestilential, and the first session of the·
new Parliament was held at the house of the preaching friars near
Ludgate. The House debated public affairs, but there are few records of
their doings on the Rolls between the day of their meeting and Dec. 17,
when they were prorogued. But it must have been to this time that t'he
following passage of Gascoigne refers. ‘The Parliament of England
(p. 190), continually worried by annoyances and expenses, openly said
that it would never grant the king a tax unless he first by the authority
of Parliament resumed all that really belonged to the Crown of England,
which the king had previously given and alienated from the Crown.' It
is also to this Parliament that we must refer the passage (p. 189) which
