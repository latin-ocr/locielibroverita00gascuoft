entreating him to re-commit Somerset into the hands of two knights, who
should convey him to the Tower into lawful custody; that this petition
was refused, and that thereupon he attacked Somerset, who was then in
St. Alban’s‚ preferring that Somerset should be taken prisoner, than that
he (the Duke of York) should be seized and slain by Somerset. No one
was spoiled of his goods with the Duke‘s will, but against it, as 1 heard
from trustworthy persons, and the Duke of York, Richard, had his
pardon or indulgence granted him by Parliament in London, along with
his adherents in the battle of St.Alban’s, for all that had been done in
that battle, and for everything occurring there, on which any man might
make plea or quarrel against the Duke or against his comrades.’ Somerset,
who was killed at St. Alban’s on May 22, 1455, with the Earl of North-
umberland, and Lord Clifford, had been released from the Tower on
Feb. 5 preceding, by the King’s writ.

The battle of St. Alban’s, though in itself a mere skirmish, developed
the inextinguishable seuds of the civil war. The quarrels os Lords Devon
and Bonvile, the feud which came from the marriage of Thomas Nevil‚
son of the Earl of Salisbmy, with the niece os Lord Cromwell, between
the bridegroom and Thos. Percy, Lord Egremont3 the anger of the
House of York at being excluded from the King·s councils, and the
sight of Somerset and the Queen in the„ conduct of all affairs, stirred
bad blood enough. The Queen, aster the loss of three among her more
zealous partisans, made up her mind to the ruin of York, and the ad-
vantage which York gained at St. Alban’s made him equally determined
to secure himself from risk by obtaining a recognised position in the state,
under the authority os Parliament. The King did his best to mediate
between the parties, and effected from time to time formal but hollow
reconciliations. But nothing could erase the bloodshed of St. Alban’s,
and as Gascoigne is fond of saying ‘sanguis sanguinem tetigit.'

The Parliament of 1455 met on July 11, and the Commons presented
Sir John Wenlok as their Speaker. They were soon prorogued to Nov.
12, for the harvest was at hand. On Nov. 19 York was again appointed
Protector‚ sor the King’s mind was again affected, though not, it appears,
so seriously on this occasion. There is, indeed, a commission issued on
June 5, to Gilbert Keymer‚ Dean of Salisbury, and Doctor of Medicine,
the King's physician, and on March 10, 1456, another commission is
