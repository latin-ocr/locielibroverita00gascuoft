INTRODUCTION. xli

One event, however, occurred in the autumn of 1457, which made
a deep impression on Gascoigne’s mind, the trial and condemnation of
Pecok. The singular circumstances which attended this trial, the fact
that this bishop is the only prelate of the pre-reformation period who
was formally condemned for heresy, the ambiguous and obscure character
of the charges made against him, and the happy accident that one of the
books at least for which he was condemned has been preserved in the
Cambridge University Library (having been printed in the Rolls' Series
by Mr. Churchill Babington), and is, apart from any intrinsic merits
which it may possess, a most interesting work, written in fifteenth-century
English by an educated churchman‚ have surrounded the memory of
Pecok with a reputation which his critics and judges would have hardly
anticipated. In his search after witnaesoe, Fox makes him a devout
precursor of the Reformation, a pious prelate who was grievously sinned
against. Lewis, who has written his life, but certainly has never read
Gascoigne’s MS„ speaks of ‘his lordship’ with similar feelings of re-
verence. Gascoigne tells us more about him than any one else, sor
he detested him heartily, and rejoices over his condemnation with the
most orthodox satisfaction.

Reginald Pecok was by birth a Welshman‚ a fellow os Oriel College,
Oxford, who at first (p. 18) had a considerable reputation for learning
and orthodoxy‚ who quitted Oxford sor the court, and graduated in
theology by special licence, or dispensation of the regents in the Oxsord
Schools (i.e. the younger masters), in the year 1445, when Gascoigne
was Chancellor (pp. 26, 215). He had been made Bishop of St.Asaph
in 1444, by the influence of two well-known persons, and forthwith took
an active part in public affairs, writing and publishing both English and
Latin books, the names of two of which, ‘De Fide’ and the ‘ Provoker,’
have been preserved by Gascoigne. In 1447 and ¹449 he preached at
Paul’s Cross‚ to the effect that bishops were not bound to preach by
virtue of their office; that originally the function of bishop and parish
priest were one, but that since the parochial clergy had been entrusted
with local duties‚ they had relieved the bishops from their previous
obligations. It appears that he published this sermon in English, and
that it made him highly popular with his episcopal brethren. He
further held that it was the bishop’s duty to be better informed abopt
