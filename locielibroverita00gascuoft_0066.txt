Harrowden, in a petition presented to the Westminster Parliament of
November, in which she gives a long and circumstantial narrative of the
manner in which her husband had been trepanned and murdered. She
claims the right of appeal to men of Northamptonshire only, on behalf
of herself, or, in the event of her death, for her son. Tresham dwelt in
his own country, and his widow knew that she could obtain justice from
the verdict of her neighbours. I have little doubt that the blow which
fell on Tresham was intended for Parliament, and that whosoever set
the assassins on, hoped that the fate of the Speaker would counsel
prudence to all constitutional reformers for the future.

If the murderers of Tresham intended to cow the Parliament, they
were for the time disappointed. The House which met on Nov. 9, 1450,
went to work on the lines of its predecessor. It elected as its Speaker
Sir William Oldhall, whose opinions it will be remembered were so pro-
nounced that in 1453 he was attainted and outlawed for having been an
associate of Cade. But its doings were not factious or revolutionary.
It began by confirming the subsidy or income-tax which had been
granted in the previous year, and made provision for an accelerated
payment of the arrears. The defaulters were to be summoned and
examined by commissionem, assigned or to be assigned by the King,
who were to have the power of punishing by fine and ransom those
who might make default‚ and by imprisonment and forfeiture those who
resisted the commissioners. To clear up doubts, the liability of the tax
is limited to those who have over 405. clear income in freehold or copy-
hold lands, and over 605. annually from office. No person who was a
member of the existing Parliament, or had been a member of the last,
was eligible as a commissioner. After sitting sor a month, during which
it endorsed the petition of Isabel Tresham, it was adjourned by succes-
sive prorogations to May 5.

It then presented an extraordinary petition to the King, requiring
him to ordain, by authority of Parliament, that certain persons, thirty in
number, should be banished from the court, at a distance of not less
than twelve miles from the king’s residence, under pain os forfeiting
lands and goods. The most important persons in this list are the Duke
of Somerset, the Duchess dowager of Suffolk‚ William Booth‚ Bishop of
Lichfield, of whom Gascoigue says that he believes (p. 194) ‘that his
