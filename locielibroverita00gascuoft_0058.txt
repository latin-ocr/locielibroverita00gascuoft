only technical, no one seems to have interposed on behalf of the
favourite.

On Jan. 26, the Commons reported to the King that the Duke ad-
mitted that there were heavy charges against him. They declared that
they were ready to make these charges good, and requested that in the >
interval Suffolk should be committed to prison.- The Lords‚ in their
capacity of the Crown’s adviserS, consulted the Judges as to the law in such
a case. After consultation with his brethren, the Chief Justice appears
to have advised thern that it was necessary,before committal on so grave
an issue, that particulars should be alleged3 for they answered on the
same day unanimously, that the Duke ought not to be taken into custody,
till the details of the charge were laid before them.

The Commoris were ready. On January 28 the Speaker‚ Thomas
Tresham, exhibited nine articles from the Lower House. In the first of
these it is stated that the Duke of Suffolk had betrothed his son John
to Margaret, the only daughter of John Duke of Somerset, who was,
sailing issue from the King, the next heir to the throne, and that since
the impeachment had been determined on, the pair had been married.
Margaret Beausort, afterwards the wife of Edmund Earl of Richmond,
and mother of Henry the Seventh, was at that time nine years old,
having been born in 1441. Suffolk's son actually married Elizabeth
Plantagenet, daughter of the Duke of Y ork, and appears to have been
neutral through the whole of the civil war. If the marriage or rather
the betrothal had taken place, it must have been subsequently rescinded,
as the marriage of young minors constantly was. But the introduction
of this statement into the indictment is important, because it shows that
as early as 1450 people were speculating as to who would be the heir to
the throne, in the probable event of Henry’s dying childless; that the
Beausorts were not considered illegitimate, while the prevalence of such
a rumour goes far to explain, concurrently with the fact that Somerset
had superseded York in the government of France, the early enmity
between the two dukes, which culminated in the affair of St. Alban's.
This indirect acknowledgment of the power of women to inherit or
transmit a title to the crown is a very significant hint that Richard
Plantagenet’s descent gave a better claim, at least theoretically, to the
throne, than that of the reigning family.
