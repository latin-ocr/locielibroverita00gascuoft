JNTROD UCTION. lxiii

and his judicial acts are to be taken according to their intention, and
their intention cannot be anything which is morally or doctrinally wrong.
A curious illustration of the view which might be taken as to his powers
is given in the account of the threat of Martin the Fifth (p. 17) to
Chichele and the other English prelates about the year ¹430· The
Pope was anxious to get the statute against Papal provisions repealed,
threatened the English bishops with excommunication for not doing
what they were unable to effect, or did not dare to attempt, and actually
suspended Chichele from his official legateship. ‘Then the bishops
openly said that a General Council was superior to the Pope, and there-
upon appealed from the Pope to the General Council which was about to
be held (of Basle), though very osten before they had held different
language, saying that the Pope was superior to a General Council, and
could dissolve it at his pleasure.’

The authority of the Papacy was very osten found to be a conve-
nient instrument of government‚ which hardly any one would be unwilling
to use on an emergency. On the other hand, the abuses of the Papal
administration were strongly resented. In the case cited above, nearly
all were unanimous in denouncing Papal provisions, that is, grants of
benefices by Papal nomination in disregard of private rights or capitular
elections. Gascoigne dwells upon several instances in which the scandal
was great3 for example, on the bribery which seated Andrew in the
deanery of York, and the disturbances which accompanied Papal inter—

were illegal, they were exceedingly frequent. The King often applied
sor them, though the grant was a breach of the law. By the Great
Charter, capitular elections were to be free. But kings wished to provide
for their friends, and it was by no means certain that chapters would attend
to royal recommendations, while they could be constrained to submission
by the threat of excommunication-—a threat which was not suffered to
lie idle—which, while in operation, deprived the people of religious
offices, and the priest of his sees—a very notable part of his income
in the middle ages. Besides, there were many ways in which the Roman
Court could revenge itself on those who defied its pretensions or its claims.
Its prohibited degrees, for example, made a dispensation for marriage
constantly necessary, for though its rule was strict, it allowed, sor a
