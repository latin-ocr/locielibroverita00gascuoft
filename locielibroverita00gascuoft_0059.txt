It was perhaps at this time, if the story which rests on the authority
of William of Wyrcestre be correct, that Thomas Young‚ member for
Bristol, a lawyer‚ and a brother-in-law of the Cannyngs, moved in Par-
liament that the Duke of York be declared heir apparent to the throne.
It is added that Young was thereupon committed to the Tower. This
story is supposed to be confirmed by the fact that nearly six years after·-
wards Thomas Young petitioned the House to the effect that he had been
arrested and imprisoned without indictment‚ and with loss of goods, for
matters said in Parliament. The Commons endorse his prayer, and
request that he may have a sufficient and reasonable recompense. The
petition is referred to the Lords of the Council to provide according to
their discretion. It seems strange, however, that Young should have
allowed so long a period to elapse without stating his grievance. Gas-
coigne, though no friend of the Royal House and the Court, is absolutely
silent as to any claim to the throne, near or remote, in the house of
York.

Suffolk was at once committed to the Tower, and on February 12
the Lords reported that in their opinion a copy of the articles of
impeachment should be supplied to the judges. From Gascoigne’s
language (p. 218) it appears that in his time a peer of Parliament‚
accused of a great crime, was tried by a jury of twelve peers, who
were to aequit or declare him guilty, no mention being made as to
the presence os the judges at the trial. The answer of Chief Justice
Gascoigne to Henry the Fourth appears to refer only to the privileges
of the episcopal order. But it is not easy to see why the judges should
be furnished with a copy of the articles, unless they were to take some
prominent part in the proceedings. The King or Queen, who evidently
thought that the affair would pass off if Suffolk were kept out of sight
for a time, refused to adopt the counsel of the Lords.

On Saturday, March 7, the Lor'ds returned to the subject, and
insisted that Suffolk should answer the charges made against him. It
is impossible to doubt that they were acting in concert with those
who had the conduct of the impeachment in the Commons‚ for on the
following Monday, March 9, the Commons, by their ‘Speaker, presented
eighteen other articles. It was necessary to meet this united attack and
these new charges. Suffolk was brought from the Tower, and the
