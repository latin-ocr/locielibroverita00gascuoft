culture in the form of a tithe. Tithes‚ it is said, were originally granted·
for the bishop, the clergy, and the poor. The monks could y claim their-
share in this wealth, as coming under the last two heads, and since they
frequently obtained an exemption from episcopal control, might even
represent the claims of the third. Nor would the parishioners of the
impropriated rectory be wronged, for the monastery would supply the
services of the parish from the monks. Resides, the efficacy of monastic
prayers was far greater than that of the secular clergyman. The offices
of the monks were cumulative, that of the parson was single: it was
the utterance of men wh0‚ being under strict vows, were the peculiar
favourites of heaven. But the parish priest was under looser obligations,
and therefore his offering was less acceptable. So fully was this feeling
entertained, that the monks were entrusted with the election of bishops
of many sees, and a monk, as we see in the rejoinder of the clerk to
Henry the Fourth‚ was deemed peculiarly fit for the episcopal office.

A reaction against the prevailing sentiment set in during the latter
part of the thirteenth century. The old monasteries were still wealthy.
and respectable, but they were insufficient for the public wants. The
pious benefactor began to found colleges and schools. All these bene-
factors copied that part of the statutes of Merton, the founder of
the first Oxford College‚ which peremptorily excluded monks from the
College. Merton was soon imitated at Cambridge. In the second
epoch of College founding, the second element in Merton’s statutes was
recognised, that of a school preparatory to, and dependent on, the Col-
lege—an institution which was provided by Merton‚ but long ago
suppressed by Merton’s fellows. The resources of these colleges were-
largely composed of impropriations. Merton had large estates, but also
the great tithes of several parishes‚ for the severance of which from the
benefices the consent of Bishop and Pope was necessary. Balliol, Exeter,
and Oriel had, in the first instance, very little besides the tithes and dues
of impropriate rectories. Magdalene, in Oxford, was largely endowed·
from this source, for the monasteries whose suppression supplied Wayn-
flete with much of his revenues had been themselves endowed in this
way. When, after the Reformation‚ this part of the monastic revenues
fell into the King's hands, and the Crown became the largest owner of*
impropriate tithe in the kingdom, Christ Church in Oxsord, and Trinity
