require more perfect works than any private rule does, and thus any
professed monk could be elected to a bishopric, and the people, who
were thus entreated‚ accepted episcopal duties. for the salvation of souls
reluctantly‚ and thereupon were translated after death by reason of their
miracles. Again‚ holy bishops of old, reflecting on the episcopal duties
put on them, did not wish to be translated from bishopric to bishopric
for the sake of larger revenues, but now they are translated from bishopric
to bishopric in their lives, and so do not deserve to be translated by the
evidence of miracles after their death. Again, in these days, men buy
their translations and their bishoprics so dearly in their lives, that they
are not worth translating after their deaths, nor that God should do
miraculous works by their merits.‘' And the clerk said to the king,
‘³ You, sir, know one man who gave two thousand marks to a great lord
to get translated from his bishopric to an archbishopric.’' The king
was pleased with the answer of that clerk.’

‘Bishops used, as one can see in the life of St. Cuthbert, to talk
humbly and familiarly with their subjects, and every day to give any one
of their subjects an audience, if he wished to converse with his bishop.
Lately a poor man carne to the servant of an archbishop, the son of
a great lord (Gascoigne must mean Stafford)‚ and said, “ I wonder that
the archbishop does not give audience in his own person to his subjects
as his predecessor did.'' The servant of the archbishop answered, “My
lord, the present archbishop, was not bred in the same way that his
predecessor was bred,’' meaning by this that his lord archbishop, who
was so strange and distant to his subjects, was the son of a lord, and his
predecessor, who had been archbishop before him, was the son of
a common man (Chichele’s father was said to have been a tailor). The
poor man answered the archbishop’s servant, “The present archbishop
and his predecessor were certainly of very different breeding‚ but it is
clear for all that, that his predecessor was the better man, and more .
useful to his subjects and their souls and the whole diocese.”' The ideal
bishop‚ to Gascoigne’s mind, was Grosteste—learned, pious, firm, wisc.
But the great Bishop of Linc01n‚ as my author kneW, was of very humble
origin. The friars minor of Oxford‚ whom in the early days of their
activity and saintliness‚ as it was thought, Grosteste protected and
assisted, (a century or more later Wiklif thought very differently of
