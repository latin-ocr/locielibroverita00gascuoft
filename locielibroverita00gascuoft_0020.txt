Χ PREFACE.

doubt that the publisher of ‘William of Wyrcestre' would
have searched in these volumes for a description of society
in England during the first half of the fifteenth century,
and would have made those extracts which Ι have- col-
lected.

I have appended to the passages taken from the Lincoln
Manuscript certain excerpta from other Manuscripts, to one of
which, that of St. Augustine’s ‘ De Civitate Dei: I have referred
above. The other volume has a curious and suggestive history.
It contained originally three different works, bound together.
The first is a Latin Psalter, annotated by Gascoigne in his
earliest hand. The second is an account of the execution of
Scrope, written by Gascoigne himself, and is, I believe, the
origin of the information we have as to the particulars of that
event. On the loose leaves of this second treatise are some
entries made by Gascoigne‚ which I have also transcribed. The
third was a Hebrew Psalter, which has been taken out of the
volume, probably a century ago, when the Library was putting
all its Hebrew books together. It is to be regretted that
a rage for uniformity has severed a volume from its place in
the book where Gascoigne had originally placed it.

This Hebrew Psalter is, I am informed, a Manuscript of
the fifteenth century, and was probably written in England.
The margin is written all over by Gascoigne‚ who was plainly
endeavouring to make himself master of the language: indeed
the MS. informs us that he began his Hebrew studies in
1431. He might have found a teacher on the spot, if the
tradition which I have often heard is correct, that when the
Jews had no legal settlement in England from the reign of
Edward the First to the Protectorate‚ a little Hebrew colony
