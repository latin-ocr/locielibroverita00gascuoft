signed with the Pope’s hand, and the grant set under a bu11.' He accuses
also the cardinals and officials of forging and altering bulls‚ of which the
Pope does not know the contents‚ or supposes to be wholly different from
what they actually are.

” ‘Modern sinners say (p. 123), “I do not care what and how many sins
Ι commit in God's sight, because I can easily and speedily get a plenary
remissiori granted me by the Pope, whose writing and grant Ι have
bought for fourpence‚ or sixpence, or for a game of tennis;'’ for they
who sell letters of indulgences go up and down the country and give
such a letter, now for twopence, now for a good drink of wine or beer,
sometimes as a wager at tennis if they lose, sometimes for the hire of
a harlot‚ and sometimes as a personal favour. Peter de Monte, who in
the year 1440 collected much money by indulgences issued by Pope
Eugenius, as he was leaving England and went on board ship, told Doctor
Vincent Clement ε “ By G——l Pope Eugenius shall not have a penny out of
these bags full of money, unless he sends me a brief promising me the
archbishopric of Milan.'’ ' The story is repeated further on with a few
variations. There were people who went about the country with baskets
full of these letters of indulgence, to sell them everywhere to all who
'might wish to buy, and some said, ‘ Now Rome comes to our door‚’ and
some did not care what crimes they committed, thinking they could easily
get pardon and grace by the Pope’s grant, so that Alfonso, King of
Aragon, said to Pope Eugenius‚ ‘Now is the Roman church truly a harlot‚
sor she lays herself out to all who ask her with money.’ Gascoigne corn-
'parffi Peter de Monte to Simon, who deemed that the gift of God could be
purchased with money. The Pope found him useful, for though he was
disappointed os the archbishopric os Milan, he was made Bishop of
Brescia. There were other people besides Gascoigne who suspected these
instruments of pardon. One of the fathers of Basle (p. 12 1) wrote a treatise
on papal indulgences, and declared that for a thousand years aster Christ,
such instruments as had become usual had never been seen.

But the scandal which affected Gascoigne more than anything else
was that which was always before his eyes, the possession of the arch-
deaconry of Oxford, under papal provision, and through the agency of
de Moleyns and Aiscough, by F ulk de Birmingham. This person, who is
not named by Gascoigne, though he tells the story more than a dozen
