purveyance on their own account. The fact is recorded, not in the
process taken against them only, but in the private accounts of indi-
viduals who were wronged‚ and whose complaints are contained in a
private audit. But in the time when nobles and gentlefolks found that
it was not worth while to cultivate their land, and more convenient
to live on rentS, when the competition of occupancy did not indeed raise
rents, which were singularly customary and immovable in the middle
ages, but lowered the rate of income on investments in land from ten to
five per cent„ and the Crown incurred debts, which turned out to be bad,
the burden of these bad debts fell on the small proprietor, whose domestic
records have not been preserved, and on the farmer who never had any
records to preserve, and thus, despite the saint on the throne, augmented
the unpopularity of poor Henry’s government. He was praying, striving
to reconcile partisans, himself no partisan, and heaping up wrath against
his party and his friends, though the strange spectacle of a wholly
saintly King continually suspended the warwhich was imminent. Had
Henry been chargeable with any vice, his throne would have passed
away in 1449. Had he possessed any administrative vigour—had
he even known the temper of his age—had he been able to interpose
between himself and his difficulties any man of financial genius (one such
man, Tresham, was murdered by Henry’s sycophants and betrayers),
such, sor instance, as James the First found in Cranfield, and William
the Third in Montague, his dynasty would have been saved. ¹

Henry‘s administration indeed, when it was on the eve of its darkest
night, had a chance, which a skilful and sagacious partisan of his, or
perhaps a servant of his exchequer‚ was able to make use of. Normandy
and Guienne had been lost, and to all appearance, lost irrecoverably.
The communications between these two great provinces had been
sacrificed by the concession of Maine and Anjou, nominally to the sham
King of Sicily and Jerusalem, Margaret's father, really to Charles of
France. For the first time in English history, an English King had
taken a portionless foreigner to wife. Had the King married an English
wife, and Gascoigne finds excellent reasons why he should do so (p. 219),
and thereupon abandoned the mischievous passion for foreign posses-
sion5‚ which only bring war and loss, and the weakening of national
ties, and national int'erests, all would have been well. Had his wife,
