lxxxviii INTRODUCTJON.

priests whom they trained, and the court made them even more depraved.
However saintly might have been the life of the king, however ardent his
piety‚ however hateful in his eyes cruelty and licentiousness were, the
age was eminently licentious and cruel. The dress of men and women
was in the last degree indecent (the fashion [p. 144] began in 1429), and
all the vices which might be expected from -such fashions followed.
The season of Christmas was profaned by ribald songs, so shocking that,
says my author, ‘an eminent person that 1 knew of, on hearing one of
these indecent ditties‚ could not get it out of his head, nor forget its
images, and became so oppressed by the recollection that he died? ‘The
season of 1457 (p. 12) was very deadly, men dying of hemorrhage from

been pleaded long and with great expense gets a settlement and con-

there were few quarrels among the people, and few lawsuits, and few
lawyers in the realm of England, and few legists in Oxford ; and then the
English judges wore, in their hoods of office, lambskins and not miniver.
It was only bishops, doctors, masters in the Universities, and lords of
Parliament, who wore miniver, ermine, and grey fur.’ ‘ Men keep to the
law (p. 127), not because it is the law, or because it is just, but because
doing thus or thus is the means for heaping up r1ches‚ and because they
