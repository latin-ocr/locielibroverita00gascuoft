schedule of which is annexed to the petition, and as, had a trial taken
place, he would assuredly have been convicted and attainted, an Act of
Parliament should be passed in proper form .to declare William de la
Pole a traitor‚ that his blood should be pronounced corrupt, his heirs
incapable of inheritance from him, and his whole estate be forfeited to
the crown‚ except such as he might hold in trust for others. The petition
prays that the same forfeiture should extend to his chattels, ,save moneys
paid by a certain date, and gifts made by the Duke to the University of
Oxford. The petition concludes by charging Pole, in addition to his other
misdeeds, with having contrived and effected the arrest‚ imprisonment‚
and final destruction of the Duke of Gloucester, with having abridged the
lives of the royal princes, and with having estranged lords who were near
in their relationship from the King. The petition was indeed rejected,
but its presentation is a proof of how profound was the dissatisfaction
which the Commons entertained towards the administration, and how
their anger was no way appeased by the exile and murder of Suffolk.

I have dwelt on these particulars at length for many reasons. In
the first place, there is no part of English constitutional history which is
more instructive, and that for several reasons, than the six years which
intervene between the summons of the London and Leicester Parliament
of 1449, and the first protectorate of the Duke of York. The par-
liamentary tactics of Tresham and Oldhall, of Thorpe and Cherleton‚
successive speakers of the House, are on the same lines with those
adopted by Eliot and Pym, Hyde and Hampden. The action of the
House is a genuine reflex of public opinion ; and they who can read
between the lines of the Rolls of Parliament can without any violent
effort recall the motives, the speech, and the acts of those who vainly
but honestly endeavoured to arrest the progress of those impulses
which were hurrying the nation into civil war. Unfortunately for the
statesman of the fifteenth century, there was no remedy to be found
against the two cankers of the time, the total corruption of the church,
and the utter lawlessness of the aristocracy. To pull down one bad
man, like Sufsolk‚ was merely to make room sor another bad man, like
Somerset. To ruin and degrade a mischievous and conceited prelate
like Pecok‚ was to make a place for an equally mischievous, more irn-
moral, and infinitely more ignorant person, like Nevil. Pecok indeed
