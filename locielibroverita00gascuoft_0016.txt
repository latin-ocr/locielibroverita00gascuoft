vi PREFACE.

legacies in his will being satisfied, he must have devised the
residue of his personalty to the new foundation, which was
dedicated among other saints to Bridget of Sweden, a per-

corrections of the margin. One or two of these, occur-ring in
passages which I have selected, have been conjecturally filled

up, but with no difficulty, eg. p. 11.
The book to which Gascoigne gave the name ‘Liber
