effected, all the consequences which actually ensued would rapidly come
to pass,

Gascoigne almost always styles himself cancellarius studii Univer-
sitatis, or Cancellarius Oxonz'ae, and sometimes cancellarius natus, even
when he is narrating the events of yoers during which the records of the
University give other Chaneellors, It seems that he uses the term natus
of himself in relation to this office, as it is used in relation to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, who he says is legatus natus papae, non legatus
missus, and that at some time the University had conferred upon him
this exceptional title. Gascoigne’s long residence in Oxford‚ his inde-
pendent position and resources, his high character and conscientiousness‚
his zeal in the discharge of his clerical and academical duties‚ his great

A century before Gascoigne’s time, he tells us that there were
thirty thousand students in Oxford‚ and that (p. 202) he counted them
from the Rolls of the old Chaneellors, when he was himself Chaneellor.
They came from all parts of Europe. Alexander V graduated at Oxford‚
and then proceeded at Paris. Students came from Bohemia, sat at the
feet of Wiklif, and carried his books back to their native country. The
number seems incredible‚ but Oxfordshire was», to judge from its rating
for exceptional taxation, after Norfolk, then at the best of its industries..
the wealthiest county in England by a considerable proportion, and the
circuit of its walls by no means included all its inhabitants, for there was
a large population on the north side of the town, and even in some os the
villages near it. This concourse of students was diverted by the great
plague‚ the ravages of which were the more serious because our forefathers
were closely packed together, and were utterly indifferent to sanitary
conditions. Even after the plague‚ the first quadrangle of New College,
minus one of the storieS, was supposed to give ample room for a warden‚
seventy fellows and scholars, ten chaplains‚ a number of clerks and
choristers‚ and servants too. The site os New College had been once
a densely peopled part os Oxford‚ but now, owing to the plague‚ was
