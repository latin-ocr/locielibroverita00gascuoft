a fellow of New†College. This prebend was worth (p. 194) only
eight marks yearly.

It appears that from his matriculation to his death, Gascoigne re-
sided almost constantly in Oxford. He was Chancellor for the first time
in 1434 (p. 116). In 1436 the University bestowed on him the special
title os ‘Doctor CatholicuS‚' and thanked him for his sermons on Easter
day, and the Wednesday in Easter week. He was Chancellor again in
1442, in 1443, when he is styled ‘Cancellarius natus,' and in 1445. It
appears that (p. 201) he was elected even more frequently, but that
he declined to hold the office, if, as seems, he is referring to himself
in the passage. In 1443 he procured from the king a charter, or
letters patent, to the effect that the Chancellor of Oxford should always
be ex qfficio a justice of the peace, and in the same year carried
a statute by which compurgation should be disallowed in the University
court, except at the Chancellor’s discretion.

Gascoigne died on some day between March 12, 1458, the date
of his will, and March 22, on which the will was proved. The in-
scription on his Brass in the chapel at New College, where he was
buried, stated that he died on the morrow of S. Gregory, i.e. March 13.
The inscription was copied by Anthony XVood, but has disappeared.
The burial of Gascoigne in the antechapel of New College was probably
a high compliment to his reputation. It was rare, perhaps unprece-
dented, that any one who was not of the Society was honoured by
sepulture within its church. The arms of his family, Gascoigne of
Hunslet‚ were engraved on his Brass.

The crooked wayS, and the gross breach of saith by which Henry
the Fourth deposed the unlucky and unpopular Richard, and set aside
the issue of Philippa, disturbed the reign of that king. He succeeded
in putting down the formidable insurrection of the Percies, who had
been his accomplices, and yet was unable to vanquish Owen Glendower
in Wales. He had to conciliate the clergy by the appearance at least
of being the patron of orthodoxy3 and inserted chapters in the statutes
os the year, in answer to their petitions‚ under which the preachers
were silenced, by limiting the right of preaching to those who were
licensed by the bishop3 and heretics were condemned to the flames,
by compelling the secular officer‚ the sheriff in the counties, and the
