held in ancient demoene, and ordinatily exempted stom parliamentary
taxation. This income-tax was graduated. Incomoe under sorty shil-
lings a-year were exempt3 on those between forty shillings and twenty
poundS, the tax was sixpence in the* pound; on those between 2620 and
ἐξ 200, it was a shilling3 on those above Α 200 a-year, two shillings.
The tax was ‘thought reasonable’ by the Lords and assented to by
the King. But 1 shall have to refer to the Parliament of 1449-50

Thorpe did not follow this precedent in 1453, bold and just as

become sor a long time a fixed quantity. The grant is to be dimi-
