lx INTRODUCTION.

only one figure in the scene to which English history affords no parallel,
that of the blameless and helpless king.

Again, in order to read between the lines of these invaluable frag->
ments of Gascoigne's ‘ Liber Veritatum,’ and to see how, with naturally
clerical leanings, he was alive to the present difficulties and impending
sorrows of his own generation, one must know the concentration of 'English
social life in the fifteenth century from its highest and widest mani-
festations in Parliament. The personality of Gascoigne is that of a well-
connected, fairly-opulent English priest‚ who was stored with the learning
of his age, was honoured by his contemporaries, was orthodox in his
beliefs, but unsparing in his condemnation of those who did not reach
what he believed to be the standard of public and private duty. Had
he set his heart on wealth, he would have done better as an honest
tailor. He has friends: Robert Thwaites, master of Baliol, and
William Grey, of the same College, afterwards Bishop of Ely, are

layman. But he has no patience with the worldly bishops, the licentious

The world of Christendom is saved by the valour of John Hunniades.
The Turk is beaten back from the walls of Belgrade3 the Papal Court is
even obliged to confess that the Hungarian hero was right in forbidding
the exportation of the nation’s wealth by the pardon-mongers who carne

monk who led the Christian host to its unequal combat with Waldewach,
but the English prelates, with Bourchier at their head (p. 48), the
successor of the slothful Kemp and the licentious stafford, gave no
thanksgiving for the deliverance of Christendom, for the first arrest
of the great wave which seemed likely to again engulf the West in
a savage barbarism. Oxford‚ indeed, had the grace to give thanks,
to sing solemn chants, to make a general procession‚ with a Te Deum
Laudamus, on St. Lucy’s morrow (September 20), when an ancient*
