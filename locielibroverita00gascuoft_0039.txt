INTROD UCTJON. xxix

though of foreign origin, come to him with that which would have set up
the King's household, and saved the peasant from the forced sale of his
ox, his wheat, his butter and cheese‚ or whatever else was the produce of
his little holding, the portion os the wife would have been a benefit, and
foreign entanglements might have been dealt with discreetly. But here
was a furious woman, who brought loss instead of gain, dishonour
instead of power, whose dower was the cession of the key to the two
great provinces which had been, with interruptions, but these usurpations,
in the hands of English kings for three centuries, and beyond all this,
was setting the good monarch against his nearest kinsfolk and best
friends, while she sacrificed all to the men who had put her in her
undeserved position. (See pp. 204, 205, 219, 220—1.) She was the evil
genius to Henry‚ as Henrietta Maria was to charles.

I have referred above to the political importance of Calais and
Normandy‚ of the control which they afforded England over the most
important commerce of the age, and os the singular financial aid which
the export of English wool afforded to the exchequer of the fifteenth
century. But the cession of Anjou and Maine was supposed to have not
only effected the loss of Normandy‚ but that of Guienne (p. 205). To
the English, the retention of Guienne was only second in importance to
Δ that of Normandy‚ and in some particulam, was even more vital. It was
the country from which England derived one of its most important
necessaries, and one of its most familiar luxuries. The reader of modern
times will readily understand why the English desired an uninterrupted
supply os Bordeaux wine, and the difference between a supply from
a foreign country, and that from one which was politically united with
England. He will understand the facts none the less clearly, when he
hears that the political severance of Guienne from England involved
a doubled price os F rench wine. As long as England held Guienne, wine
was procured at prices so low, that it was within the reach of persons who
had moderate incomes. When the French King regained it, or rather
usurped it, the produce of the country was accessible only to the compara·
tively wealthy. This, however, might be borne3 but there was a further
loss in the revenue derivable from this ancient province os England.

My reader will be perhaps surprised to hear that this more serious
difficulty was the loss of a cheap market sor salt. But such is the fact.
