whose resignation was neither so complete nor so pious as that os Gas-
coigne. Suffolk, they concluded, had brought another Helen to new Troy.

Gascoigne tells a curious story about the marriage of Margaret
(pp. 190, 205, 219). He says that aster Suffolk had negotiated the
marriage, he lost >sight of Margaret, and remained seventeen weeks in
France, without knowing where she was3 that subsequently he returned
to England and procured a grant from Parliament‚ and on returning to
France, found that Margaret was *detained by the French King, who, on
the ground that she was Queen of England, and had no ‘ safe conduct ²
out of F rance, declared that she should not be given up without ransom,
and that he, fearing the consequences‚ induced the King to resign Maine
and Anjou under the Great Seal, in order to get possession of the King’s
affianced wife. This cession, says Gascoigne, not only eost England
Normandy and Guienne, but put the French into such a position that
they-could resuse the payment of an annual tribute sor the cession of the
provinces, and were even able to evade a final peace between the two
kingdoms.

There are few portions of the parliamentary history of England
which can be more fully written out than that of the years 1453-4.
In 1452 the Gascons, who had been annexed to the F rench Crown aster

the King of France thicker than the loins os the King of England, and
were irritated at the taxes which their new master heaped on them.
He had perhaps imposed, in imitation of the export duties on wool,
export duties on wine and salt, and they had found that soreigners did not
pay these taxes, but that the impost damaged Gascon trade. At any
rate, they sent envoys to the English Court‚ promising to revolt if they
were assisted by a competent force. Their offers were accepted, and the
old Earl of Shrewsbury, who had risen to an earldom by his conduct in
the war of the French successim, was made Lieutenant of Guienne on
September 3. There seemed to be a chance that the events os 1450
would be reversed, and on March 6, 1453, a Parliament was summoned,
in which Thomas Thorpe, one of the officials of the Exchequer, and six
years afterwards one of its barons, was elected speaker. The House,
in the absence of the Chancellor (Kemp), was addressed by the Bishop
of Lincoln‚ who declared that the cause of the summons was the sound
