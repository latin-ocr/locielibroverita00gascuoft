them), kept the good bishop’s rushen sandals (p. 141) in their convent
library‚ not in that os the students.

To go a little beyond the bounds of Gascoigne's lise, no one who
studies the history of the fifteenth century, especially that period
between 1449—1461, from which so. many important constitutional
principles can be, as they have been, derived, can fail of being struck
with the singular facility with which the prelates of the age accom-
modated themselves to the timec, without exception. Mr. Anything‚
or Mr. Facing-both-ways, in Bunyan’s allegory‚ were prentices to them.
Every English revolution, except that of the Royal Succession‚ has had
its episcopal partisans. Most of the English hierarchy were sacrificed
at the Conquest. william the Second, Henry, Stephen‚ had their
friends and foes on the episcopal bench. Henry the Second was in the
same position. John had to face a true patriot in Stephen Langton,
whom the Pope put on him, a man whose career and conduct must have
surprised the Pope as much as it daunted John. Henry the Third had
his allies among the prelates‚ and so had Simon de Montfort. Edward
had a struggle with them and quelled them. His miserable, foolish,
disreputable son had a foe in Orleton and a friend in Stapledon. Merks,
is we can trust the story, strove to maintain the rights of Richard the
Second, even when his cause was quite hopeless, as Arundel aided Henry.
But no man among the bishops of Henry's time, even those who owed
everything to him—men like Lyhart and Wainfieet, Chedworth, Car-
penter, Booth, Low—appears to have helped him by word or deed.
Bourchier had been made archbishop during Henry's insanity; Nevil
during the first captivity of Henry, i. e. aster St. Alban’s. But Bourchier
served every change with uniform pliancy. He crowned Edward the
Fourth in 1461. He had no scruple in welcoming the restoration of
Henry in 1471. He congratulated the conqueror of Barnet and
Tewkesbury. He acknowledged the title of Edward the Fifth‚ accepted
the usurper's claims with alacrity‚ and wheedled Elizabeth WVoodvile out
of her other boy, who was with her in sanctuary. The last public act of
his long and contemptible career—for he was primate for thirty-three
years—was to crown the founder of the house of Tudor. Among the
odious prelates of the fifteenth century this selfish, sordid, heartless‚
time-serving churchman is the least respectable. Gascoigne formed
