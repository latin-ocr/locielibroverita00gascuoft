the more abstruse points of theology, and not to trouble-themselves
about giving that elementary instruction which may be well left to the
parochial clergy and the curates‚ unless they ‘think proper3 that they
may be very reasonably absent from their dioceses if they have more
important work to attend to, which it may be their duty to perform,
there being many more important spiritual functions for a bishop than
preaching sermons, He further held that neither pope or bishop were
simoniacal in giving and accepting papal provisionS‚ and by paying and
receiving the first-fruits of benefices. This denial of the obligation to
preach Pecok afterwards sostened down to a statement that bishops are
not bound to preach in the customary manner, viz, by taking a text and
dividing its matter into heads. This explanation (p. 35) did not satisfy
his hearers, who said ‘That bishop is now preaching publicly, and
showing that his deeds and his words are contradictory.' ‘ The fact is,'
says Gascoigne‚ ‘he was always altering what he uttered, and when
pressed to explain his published opinions, tried to escape by saying that
uncorrected and unauthorized works of his got into circulation.'

Perhaps these opinionS, though they grievously offended such zealous
and diligent preachers as Gascoigne and some of his friends were, might
have been tolerated, had he not entered on the dangerous ground of
disparaging great ecclesiastical authorities. Thus he allowed himself
to state that the works of Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine‚ and Gregory
were of no higher authority than those of ordinary men, and are quite
as much open to question. He also denied the authority of the
Apostles' creed‚ which he alleged to be of far later date than the
Apostolic age3 and in particular asserted that the descent into hell
was an interpolation of no authority whatsoever, not being in the
creed in the time of Augustine (p. 210). He further averred that
reason was superior to authority, and hinted not obscurely his doubts
about the incarnation. ‘He put‚’ says Gascoigne (p. 211), ‘the law of
nature above Scripture and above the Sacraments‚ and said in word and
deed, “my soul loatheth this light food‚’' meaning the works of the
fathers and other saints.' It was, perhaps, a minor matter, that he
held that the constant attendance of the bishops at court, and their
filling offices of state, was not only excusable but commendable, and
that the income of ecclesiastics was as much their own to dispose of
