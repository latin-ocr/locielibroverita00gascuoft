a fair judgment of him, even though he condemned and degraded
the hateful Pecok.

The last conclusion which the Council of -Constance condemned in
Wiklif’s doctrines is very sweeping and very startling. ‘ Omnes religiones
indifferenter derivantur de Diabolo.' By this generality Wiklif meant
the monks, in whom he discovered much evil and no good. They were
the Pope's army of occupation in England‚ and Wiklif hated them as an
Englishman of the fourteenth century hated the Avignon popes, and as a
Reformer of the sixteenth who had come to the conclusion that the Pope
was Antichrist would hate the Pope's police. Gascoigne is loyal to the
Pope, though he has great misgivings, but he loves the-*monks little more
than Wiklif did. The fifteenth century was not friendly to the religious
orders. Henry the Fifth, a very devout prince‚ did what his great-
grandfather, with an equally good reason for it, did not venture on
doing, for he suppressed the alien priories. The example was followed.
Alcock suppressed a nunnery at Cambridge for the purpose of founding
a college there, and Waynflete contrived to do the same by Selborne, at
least, The wealthy prior of Selborne was certainly—I have read his
household accounts—a very luxurious and probably a very scandalous
person, who surrendered on the understanding that a round annuity
should be paid him in consideration of his vested interests. But I do
not remember to have read of the foundation of more than one new
monastery in the fifteenth century. This was the splendid and wealthy
house of Sion, which Henry the Sixth endowed with part of that which
remained to him of the alien priories, the residue being devoted to
Eton and King’s (or St. Nicholas') College, Cambridge. The occasion
of the foundation of Sion was the cultus of a new and a royal saint,
St. Bridget of Sweden‚ in whose hohness, revelations, and miracles
Gascoigne is a firm believer, e. g. pp. 140, 156, 165, 169.

Wealthy men in the fifteenth century founded schools, colleges,
and chantries, established collegiate churches‚ of which Gascoigne highly
approves, provided the clergy in them keep residence‚ and built magni-
ficent churches. The architecture of the age has lost all grace, has none
of that poetry in stone which an older and more imaginative generation
possessed in sulness, but, according to the character of the society which
produced it, is massive and business-like. But no one cared to found
