clergy. But this is improbable. Henry seems to have entered on the
French war, partly with the view of recovering at least that which had
been lost by the rupture os the peace of Bretigny, but quite as much
with the object of chastising the frightful scandals of the French Court
and of French society. The language in which he announces and
justifies his purposes is like that of a Puritan commander in the early
days of the Civil War, as if he were one who was sent by God to chastise
the guilty. Severely orthodox‚ scrupulously just, a model of private
virtue, of dauntless heroism‚ of consummate military skill, and favoured
by unexampled good fortune, he united all the qualities which the
English admire, but have hardly ever witnessed together in their most
popular kings. Henry urged on the assemblage of the Council of
Constance, in order to effect the union of the distracted church.
If his conscience would not allow him to spare the heretic‚ his bene-
·volence induced him to condescend to argue with the sectaries,
whose opinions, as he believed, were ruinous to those who held them,
invited the wrath of God, and threatened the downfall of society.
His army, well drilled and invincible, was, as far as the king could
make it, as secure in its own discipline, as confident in the genius of
its general, and as pious as Cromwell’s Ironsides‚ but as severe in
the hour of battle and of victory. But the English army under the
Plantagenet kings rarely suffered a defeat. Unlike the national levies
of other countries‚ it was from an early period an enlisted‚ picked, drilled,
and highly effective service. The church and the king’s army were the
two roads to fame and wealth, by which a peasant or even a serf could
rise to a bishopric or a knighthood. In the end, this army was divided
between rival partisans‚ who fought with intermissions through the thirty
years’ war of succession, till, worn into two fragments, the relies encoun-
tered at Bosworth‚ and the succession was changed again.

The war with France was continued with hardly a truce from
August 11, 1415, when Henry the Fifth sailed from Southampton, till
July 17, 1453, when Talbot and his son fell before Chatillon. It did not
exhaust the wealth of England, but it demoralised the English people,
and gave occasion to the civil war, which, without materially diminishing
the national resources, destroyed the English nobility, exterminated the
military classes, weakened the spirit of enterprise, disturbed sor more
