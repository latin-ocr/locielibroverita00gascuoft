his own name), who had held long conversations on the facts with
Erasmus Fullar, who had been present at the battle, and had much to

at St. Paul’s outside Rome3 of the infamous murder of Thomas de
Calva, and of God’s judgments on the two cardinals who persecuted him.
One can almost see him, feeble in health‚ but full of zeal, in his upper
chamber in Oriel College‚ which the fellows had gratefully settled on

the Sixth in 1378, and was continued down to the election of Martin
the Fisth in 1417. One attempt was made after this date to renew the
schism on the election of the Duke of Savoy by the Council of Basle in
1439, under the name of Felix the Fifth. Since this time the Roman
