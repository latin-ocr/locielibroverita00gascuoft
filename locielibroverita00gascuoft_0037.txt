and the arrears owing for the purveyance of provisions was an intolerable
grievance. The necessary expenses of the household were {24000
a-year‚ irrespective of extraordinary charges. The ‘livelihood ’ of the
King had sunk to 365,οω a-year. The House of Commons attempted
to grapple with the difficulty. The'y appropriated, from various sources
of the hereditary revenue, as yet I presume untouched, 125, 582 185. 73d.
for the payment of those who supplied provisions to the household‚ and
put the proceeds into the hands of the Steward, Treasurer‚ and Comp-
troller of the Household for the time being. They added to this sum
all the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster, saving the Queen’s jointure‚
the fees, wages, reparations‚ costs and expenses of the Duchy‚ a large
exception. They fortified their resolution by drawing up the limitation in
the ordinary form of a modern act, By the King, with the advice and assent
of the Lords spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons in Parliament,
and declared that it should hold sor seven years from May 7, 1450.

After less than four years, the act was repealed, and a more man-
ageable but slightly smaller income was devised. The first grant set
aside 122 sources of revenue. The next sought to procure {5187 65. 8d.
from 22 sources. Then came the civil war, and the epoch of bad
debts on the part of the Crown. There can be no doubt that the old
arrears were swept away into the unknown, and that the deficit on the
experiment of 1450 followed them. The House of Commons‚ in the
Parliaments of 1450 and 1453, was as incapable of checking and con-
trolling the charges of the Administration as the House of Commons is
in 1880. The difference is that men wondered and were rebellious in
the former period. But the art of the financier is so subtle in our time,
that men wonder and are patiently impoverished.

The taxation of the fifteenth century was, except for the import
duties, which were insignificant, and the export duties on wool and hides,
which a modern Chancellor of the Exchequer might well envy, all direct.
The Crown had a right of preemption of all products and all services,
and as a mle, it did not abuse the power. In the many thousands of
accounts which I have read, I have seldom discovered any evidence of
wrong doing on the part of the King’s purveyors, as long as the accounts
display the debits and credits of nobles and of wealthy corporations. It
is true that the Despencers in Edward the Second’s time ventured on
