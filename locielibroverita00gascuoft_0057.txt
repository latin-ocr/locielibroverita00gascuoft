INTRODUCTION. xlvii

speaks of the threats which were made against the Commons by the
king and his young counsellors; and of the orders given to the House,
that they should proceed with that business which the king put before
them, and not meddle with the acts of the king and those of his lords.
It is plain that in the session before 'Christmas they had debated topics
which were unpleasing to the court, had delayed supply, and had begun
to contemplate an act which would afford the gravest and most serious
precedent in Parliamentary action. On Dec. 17 the House is adjourned
to Jan. 22.

On Jan. 9, Adam de Moleyns, Lord Privy Seal and Bishop of
Chichester, one of the aristocratical prelates whom Gascoigne describes
(p. 39-40) as constantly hanging about the court, neglecting the care of
their dioceses, and collecting fortunes by very doubtful, perhaps dis-
creditable expedients (p. 174), who had been engaged with Suffolk in
negotiating the marriage of Margaret and Henry, and the cession of Anj ou
and Maine, was murdered at Portsmouth by divers sailors and others
there. He had gone to Portsmouth to see about the troops for the F rench
service, and probably to pay them or arrange for their pay. He was not,

for it is stated that he alleged in his defence, that he was not responsible
for the losses which the country had suffered, but the Duke of Suffolk
only, the King’s minister and the Queen’s favourite, who was, as he
alleged, in collusion with F rance. It is to such an understanding that
Gascoigne refers when he narrates the conversation (p. 205) between
Powntes‚ the F rench herald-at-arms, and St. Barb, a Somersetshire
esquire.

The determination to attack Suffolk was matured in the Christmas
receSS. On the day that Parliament met, the Duke petitioned the king to
the effect that rumours had been current against his loyalty and character,
and that the Commons had eagerly adopted and given shape to them.
He protested that he was innocent, appealed to the services of his family
and himself, of how many of them had lost their lives in the king’s
service, and begged that he might meet his accusers. The circumstances
remind one of the trial of another royal favourite and unpopular minister
190 years later. Suffolk was well-nigh as friendless, even in the Lords,
as Strafford waS, for beyond the protest of Lord Beaumont, which is
