educated within the same college. So George Nevil, Bishop of Exeter,
the son of the Earl of Salisbury, was at Balliol, Archbishop Courtenay
was at Exeter, Archbishop Arundel was at Oriel ; but they were there, as
the Duke of Exeter’s sons were in the early part of the same century at
the King's Hall, Cambridge, lodgers on pension within the precincts of
a humble foundation. So Gascoigne himself lived at Oriel: the only
fellow of which, or indeed of any college, that he recognises in his book
is the hateful Pecok. He did not concern himself with institutions which
were at that time mere excrescences on the University, and were inhabited
by students, who were only just different from monks by the rule of their
foundation, and bettered their fortunes by turning monks. The day
had not come for the more opulent college of Waynflete, into which
Cecily, the mother of Edward IV, vainly begged the bishop to introduce
a prote'ge of hers. Besides, a country gentleman, whose conscience had
led him to take Orders, was not likely to trouble himself about places
where pauper students were housed, and in which only one person, the
head, was, like an abbot, allowed to be wealthy.

In the fourteenth century, Oxford had stood up bravely for Wiklif,
and had disclaimed him and his followers only under the serious threat
that they would forfeit their privileges if they did not. That this
coercion did not extinguish heresy is to be expected and was proved.
The open expression of opinion might have been prevented, but it was
no gain for the University that Peter Payne, alias Clerk, alias Freyne,
alias Inglis (p. 187) stole the seal of the University, and induced the
Bohemians to believe that all Oxford was of Wiklif's way of thinking,
and Gascoigne to lament (p. 50) over the praetensi scolares Oxonz‘ae. In
1410, the authorities condemned Wiklif and burnt his books at Carsax.
But, in 1452, as I have noted in the sheets of my forthcoming volumes on
Prices, a book of Wiklif, and other books bearing on the controversy
which he raised, were bought in Oxford at a cost of 535.

The violent suppression of free opinion in Oxford was a turning-point
in the history of the University. It lost its spirit, and became a home for
adventurers and loungers. It could not be brought to denounce Pecok
(p. 38), when London and Cambridge were loud against him, for sear of
displeasing the bishops, though two Oxford clerks tried to prove he
was in the right, and were baffled. It was a place where idle and non-
