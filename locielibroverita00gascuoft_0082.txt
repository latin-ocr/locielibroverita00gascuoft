Arundel and his bishops, and agreed to by the Convocation of Can-
terbury‚ by which preaching without the license of the diocesan was
inhibited. The motive is stated in the preamble of the Act to be
‘that the heretics make unlawful conventicles and confederacies, hold
and exercise schools, make and write books? The Act did not, I ima-
gine, trench on the privileges of either University, for the grant of
a degree in Divinity has from time immemorial licensed the recipient*
to lecture on the Epistles in the case of a bachelor, and on the whole.
of Scripture in the case of a Doctor, and till recently, did not require
priest's ordination for the inferior degree in Divinity.

Gascoigne tells us that Arundel (who had been banished by Richardff
for participation in the reforms projected by the lords appellants, and
was doubtlessly much more of a politician than of a divine), was only
a bachelor of arts in Oxford, that is, had merely obtained the slightest
rudiments of an academical education. He had studied at Oriel, and
Gascoigne would have heard about him> as a member of the same
college. He was not likely to know or discover what would be the
consequence of his enactment. The heretical preachers were not si-
lenced, and the orthodox were. One of these Wikltiffite preachers,-
William White, was very busy in disseminating the gospeller's creed.-
He had been a priest, had cast away his orders, had married a wife, and
went about the country on his m-ission, chiefly in eastern England. F or'
a long time he escaped, and seemed to bear a charmed life, for probably
the Norsolk weavers sympathised with him, harboured and h-id him. At
last he was caught in Norwich, tried by the bishop‚ condemned, handed
over to the secular arm, under the statute de heretico comburendo, and
burnt in the courtyard before the cathedral close. When Ι happened>
to be at Norwich, just after the recess of 1880, I inspected the Corpora-
tion accounts, and found under the year 1427 what it eost the Corporation¹
to burn William White, and two other heretics, William Whaddon and
Hugh Pye. They were not the only victims of the year. .

The grant of the license to preach was abused. The bishops
issued very few licenses, exacted large sums of money for their letters
and their seaIS‚ and made the license revocable at pleasure. ‘The
bishops do not preach, and will not suffer others to do so, except at
the entreaty of great lords. It may be proper that the unworthy should
