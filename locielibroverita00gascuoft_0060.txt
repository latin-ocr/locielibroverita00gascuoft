particulars were read in his hearing. He asked for copies, which were
granted, and he was now put into custody in a tower in the palace of
Westminster. On the following F riday, March 13, he made his defence
before the King and the Lords. Had the trial pmceeded, it seems
certain that he would have been convicted, his principal enemy in the
Lords at that time, Lord Cromwell‚ being active in pressing forward the
accusation. To save his minister, Henry took the matter into his own
hands. On March 17, without affecting to pronounce any judgment on
the merits of the articles of impeachment, he bade him go into banish-
ment for five years, on or before May 1, and to any country except France.
The Peers, through Lord Beaumont, the Constable of England, protested
that this act of the King was not done by their advice, assent, or desire.
On May 25 Lord Beaumont was ejected from his office, and the Earl of
Northumberland, afterwards a zealous partisan of the house of Lancaster‚
was put in his place. Even he, however, was superseded on September

affixed to the doors of churches and other public buildings, and all

Sufsolk remained at his estate till the time appointed for his banishment,
engaged in arranging his affairs. It was at this time that he wrote that
long and interesting letter to his son which was printed by Fenn. His
voyage from Ipswich, his capture by the Nicholas of the Tower, and his
mock trial and execution, are told by all historians. Gascoigne informs
us (p. 7), on the authority of one of the Duke's servants, that the astro-
logers had told him, as he lay in the Tower of London, that if he
escaped thence, their lives for it, he would not die a violent death, and
that Suffolk's escape from the Tower was effected under the King's
private orders.

The Commons met on the appointed day at Leicester, and imme-
