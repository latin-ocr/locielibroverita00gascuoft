as the private or secular estate which they or others might enjoy (p. 100).
To Gascoigne, however, such tenets or rules of conduct were as odious
as any heresy, and in his opinion the principa} causes of corruption in
Church and State. ‘ He claimed‚’ says my author, ‘to be tried by his
pects, by which he did not mean the English bishops, who were not at
that time, as some thought, found to be competent, but he wanted to
have such examiners of his books as he called his peers in scholastic
disputations, and in the popularity which he expected to get from his
young parfisans, who were noted sor unsound belief, and reputed to be
his followers.’

Pecok waS, it appears, an erastian‚ to use a phrase of later theology.
He held that a man ought to believe that there is a Catholic Church,
but need not abide by its decisions is he has sufficient ground for object-
ing in his own mind against them (pp. 100, 214). But his objections
were to be esoteric‚ not schismatic‚ and to be coupled with outward con-
formity. He would have the laity respect the motives and accept the
teachings of the clergy, that it should not break away as the Lollards
and Bible men did, but he would exact no more than conformity. But
it is again difficult to doubt that he inclined to Arian tenets, if Gascoigne
(p. 217) is correct in ascribing the couplet to him, for which he supplies
a rejoinder. ‘ The law of England is that the lords of Parliament‚ when
accused of any great crime, should by twelve lords barons‚ their own
peers, be acquitted of the crime charged against them, or be pro-
nounced guilty3 but that Bishop Pacok’ (Gascoigne is plainly punning
on his name), ‘a Welshman by birth, accused these holy old doctors
of salsehood, or incompleteness in their writings, but he was proved to
be their equal, neither in holy life, nor in their great learning and
miracles, and se, in rejecting them, he shot his arrow at the sun, and
his own arrow, by the just judgment of God, fell on the proper head
of that Bishop of Chichester‚ Reginald Pacok.’

Still it is not probable that the bishops of= Pecok’s day would have
proceeded to such lengths against their brother, who had excused them
their duties so handsomely, and in his book, ‘ The Repressor of too much
blaming of the Clergy,' had published a defence of the whole clerical
order, had he not committed some other fault. This I think must have
been the letter which Pecok sent in 1456 to Cannyng, the Lord Mayor
