ruinous, deserted, and a hiding-place for thieves and other bad characters.
I see no reason to doubt the statement about the exceeding populousness
of Oxford in the first half of the fourteenth century. The University had
great privileges and a great reputation, and Oxford was a secure retreat
against violence, for it was almost the strongest fortress in England,
probably even stronger than London. ,

The University annually elected two Officers, who represented them
in the conduct of academical business, and a Chancellor who presided
over the deliberations of the University parliament‚ kept order, and con-
ferred degrees. It appears that on a sufficient representation made to
the Proctors by Masters of the University, the two Proctors, that is the
officials who acted on behalf of the general body of superior graduates,
were bound to bring forward in the form of a statute the proposals made
to them. The Masters and Doctors also elected the Bedels‚ who were at
once the body-guard of the Chaneellor, and were invested with important
functions in the University. A smaller body, known early as the Con-
gregation of the University and consisting of the younger Masters, gave
graces for degrees. The fact that this important function was conferred
on the junior members of the University is explained or justified on the
ground that those who were nearest to their own exercises were the most
competent persons to judge of the qualification of others. The election
of the Proctors often ended in riot and bloodshed, and the graduates of
the University were not only exceedingly tenacious of their privileges,
but warmly resented any interference from bishop, abbot, or other spiri-
tual authority, had a perpetual feud with the monks, and occasionally
provoked some serious quarrels with the townsfolk.

Degrees were conferred in consideration of the success with which
the candidate defended or impugned some thesis. The process was a
kind of logical duel, in which one of the parties affirmed, the other
denied a position. There was no limit to the subject of debate.
Admitted principles of mental science, fundamental rules of moral
conduct and duty, the highest verities in religion and church government‚
were open in these formal disputes to attack and defence. The reader
will see one of these on p. 182. It is possible that the sceptical faculty
which this kind of exercise developed may account for the innovation
which Bishop FlemIng (p. 185) introduced in 1420 into the Oxford
