xxvi INTROD UCTION.

Henry the Fifth‚ was a saint. He *was not a monk, as some have
said, for the English monk of the fifteenth century 'was, as a rule, a
gross and greedy voluptuary, whom no one respected, but no one yet
saw how to get decently rid of, except piecemeal, as for example when
Waynflete was founding his college at Oxford, and Alcock his at Cam—
bridge. Nor did 'Henry affect asceticism‚ or pretend to dispense with
natural affections. He loved his mother, he was warm-hearted to all his
kinsfolk, he loaded the man who was afterwards 'his rival with benefits,
he heaped favours on the Neviles, who owed everything to his dynasty,
and on the MowbrayS, who had been the hereditary foe-s of his family, as
well as on the Beauforts‚ the PercieS, and the Poles, who were his para-
sites and his ruin. He was gentle and affectionate to the imperious
woman whose fortunes were tied to ⁴his own, whose mad fury destroyed
his dynasty by putting an end for ever at Coventry to all hopes of
reconciliation between the factions, whose northern army, by its
devastationS, set all Eastern England and London against the house
of Lancaster. He bore no malice to the savage old pedagogue War-
wick, who seems to have scourged all spirit out of him in his youth.
Henry was the only English saint of the fifteenth century.

As a king, Henry was the most unlucky of English monarchs.
He inherited a war, in which indeed he took no part, except as part of a,
pageant. The war which made others rich made him a pauper. Sir
John Fastolfe and Lord Cromwell collected gigantic fortunes from their
spoils and from lucrative trade. The opulence of the houses of Nevile,
Beaufort, Holland‚ Pole‚ stafford, and the rest, was prodigious. The
riches of the English nobles were a matter of wonder even to those who
had been familiar with the wealth of the house of Burgundy, and of the
Flemish burghers. But the English King‚ on whom and on whose
revenue the cost of all the administration was imposed, was far poorer
than most of the nobles who supported his throne, and had good reason
for supporting it, but were quarrelling over the succession; while an
infinite mob (we can read them in the exceptions to the acts of resump-
tion) was squabbling over the plunder of the Crown, which was really the
plunder of the nation. (Rot. Parl. iv.)

Matters came to a crisis in 1450. The debts of the Crown, mainly
for the maintenance of the King’s household‚ amounted to 5372900,
