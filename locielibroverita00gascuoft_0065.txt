subject of Henry. In those days, blood feuds were not early forgotten‚
and it is worth noting that Thomas Tresham, his eldest son, of whom
we shall hear presently, was Speaker os that Coventry Parliament in
which the family of the Duke of York and all his adherents to the
number of twenty-four were attainted, and was himself attainted after
Towton, though restored by Edward IV. His grandson, Roget Tresham,
was also a Lancastrian, served in this interest at Empingham, was at-
tainted in 1475, and restored by Henry VII.

The Speaker of the House which had lately separated, we can
hardly say had been dissolved, during the hurry and alarm of Cade’s
insurrection, had appointed to meet the Duke of York, probably at his
castle of Fotheringay, who was now returned from Ireland. where he
had been sent, says Gascoigne, against his will by the King (p. 42). It
was known that Somerset was on the point of returning from F rance,
and it was feared, we may conclude, that Somerset would be worse than
Suffolk. It was known also that another Parliament must speedily be
summoned, if indeed the writs for that which met on November 6th
were not already issued. It was certain that Tresham would again be
Speaker, and it was natural and proper that the Duke of York, who
had taken no part in the prosecution of Suffolk, and had not yet quar-

kingdom. One Simon Norwich, who it is suggested was an agent of
Lord Grey de Ruthyn, the head of a family which was peculiarly inso-
lent, perfidious, and unmanageable, even in that bad age, determined to
waylay and murder the Speaker. It was necessary, however, to learn
the route which Tresham intended to take. Norwich therefore sent a
spy, who insinuated himself into Tresham’s confidence, and became
acquainted with the plan of his journey. On Sept. 22, as Tresham and
his son Thomas were riding from their home at Sywell to the con-
serence, the assassins, to the number of 160 or more, set upon Tresham
when he was a little ahead of his retinue‚ at Thorplandclose, near
Moulton in Northamptonshire, murdered the father, wounded the son,
and robbed them both, the father of a collar of the King's livery-—a
significant fact, a gold chain, signet, and jewels, horse, and 2620 in
money3 the son, of his horse and personal effects. These particulars
are stated by the widow, Isabel Tresham, a daughter of Vaux of
