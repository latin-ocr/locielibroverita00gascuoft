mischies is, that founders and their successors should strictly enjoin,
under heavy penalties‚ that if any of their foundationers takes any license
against the will and statutes of the founder, he shall be τῷΔ-ο facto deprived
of all right to any benefit accruing to the foundationers‚ and it shall even
be ordained by the founder or by parliamenta that the heir or successor
os the founder shall expel the culprit who will not obey the founder's
statute, that he shall have no power of appeal, and that any appeal he
may make shall be a nullity.’

With such bishops and such monks, with dignities openly sold at
Rome and scandalously misapplied in England, it was not likely that
the parochial clergy would be of a very high order. The proceedings
commented on above had impoverished them, the fears and the jealousy
of the bishops had silenced them, and the Lollards derided these mass-

pastors than on the vices of bad ones, on the fact that a few were found

rather than on the shortcomings of the order to which he belonged3

salvation of the country, as in their absence it was hurrying to de-
struction. But he does tell a few stories about dissolute clergymen, and
hints that there are many such. I have thought it⁴ necessary to quote
some very plain speaking in the extracts which I have made, but I have
been constrained to omit some of the particulars which my author’s
indignation induced him to record.

The most remarkable and the lengthiest production in the ‘Liber
Veritatum’ is the dissertation or sermon on the seven streams of Babylon,
pp. 53—99. This is probably a concio ad clerum, a discourse addressed to
the University‚ and is very instructive, not only as a specimen of an
elaborate fifteenth-century sermon, but as a statement of the condition of
the Church at the time in which it was composed. The seven streams
are: 1. The unworthy and scandalous ordination and institution of
bishops», rectors‚ and officials, which is called promotion. 2. The absence
os a good rector from a people whom he should govern. 3. Pluralities.
4. The appropriation or annexing of churches and tithes to those who
have not the immediate cure of the parishioners, 5. The abuse of
absolution by priests. 6. The abuse of indulgences. 7. The abuse of
