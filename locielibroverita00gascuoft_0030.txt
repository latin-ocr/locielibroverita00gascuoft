mayor or bailiffs of the cities and towns, to put into execution the
decrees of the bishop's court. Universal suffrage was granted in
the counties, and the language of the Commons was bold and even
minatory. No English sovereign, perhaps, whose life ended naturally,
had a more troubled and unhappy reign. He was born in the same
year as the cousin whom he deposed, and died before he reached
the 47th of his age. The attitude taken towards him, in what Gas-
coigne calls the letters patent of Norfflumberland, Edmund Mortimer,
and Bardolf‚ is that of charging him with perjuries, calling on him to
resign his kingdom to the right line, claiming that the Iords of the
kingdom should be judged by their peers, that the king's council
should be reformed, that the sheriffs should be freely elected, and that
the privileges of Parliament should be respected. These articles, copied
by Gascoigne in his earlier hand, are interpolated in his latest, and
it seems clear that, in the minds of many persons, the succession of
the sixth Henry was tainted by the usurpations of the fourth. There
is not indeed the least hint in the ‘Liber Veritatum’ that the claims
of Richard of York were conceived to be superior to those of the
reigning monarch, or that the missortunes of Henry’s reign should
be a pretext for his deposition, still less that the young prince, Edward
of Lancaster, as the partisans of the rival house at last affirmed, was
supposititious, or even worse.

The defects in Henry's title, the perjuries or the harshness by
which he had gained and kept his crown, the mean concessions by
which he had disarmed or conciliated opposition‚ were forgotten in
the splendid career of his son. Henry of Monmouth was twelve years
old at the time of Richard's deposition, and sixteen when he fought
at Shrewsbury against the Percies. Perhaps the stories of his wild
youth are exaggerations, suggested by the stern morality of his riper
years, Never has an English king been more thoroughly popular than
Henry the Fisth. A conspiracy against him in the beginning of his
reign was put down without difficulty, and with little scandal. It is
stated that Henry was induced to undertake the conquest of F rance,
or at least the recovery of Normandy and Guienne‚ at the instance
of Chichele, the newly-appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, in order
to ward off a threatened attack on the temporalities os the regular
