gested that the king‘s mind was again clouded in the second half of the
year 1456. In February and March 1457, the king was at Coventry
and Banbury, in June he was at Coventry again, in July at Kenilworth.
The letter was probably received by the Council in November, shortly
before the bishop’s expulsion from the Council. From August 1, 1457, to
June 8, 1459, all the instruments in Rymer are witnessed at Westminster.
InJuly 1459, the king is at Coventry, whither he went again in November
to hold the Parliament of Coventry. But what it was that Pecok wrote
to Cannyng is, and probably will remain, unknown. That Henry and his
counsellors were entirely deceived as to the ultimate intentions of the
Yorkist party is plain, by his having conserred the government of Calais
on Warwick. It is possible that the party had no ultimate intentions till
aster the Coventry Parliament. It is possible that the bishop divined
their motives, and that they thought it convenient to destroy him. It is
certain that Henry was convinced of Pecok's heresy, for he inserted in
the statutes of King's College, Cambridge, a new clause, bidding the
sellows expel any of their number who might incline to Wikliff’s or
Pecok's tfflching.

Gascoigne tells (p. 176) a characteristic story of the king. He had
gone to Windsor, probably to ask the king to grant that charter to
Oxsord University‚ by which the Chancellor was ex officio a justice of
the peace. ‘ The king asked me at his Castle of Windsor, “ Why, Doctor
Gascoigne, are you not a bishop?'' and Ι answered him, “ Sir, I tell you, if
I wished to honestly get much‘money‚ I would rather be a good tailor
than the most learned doctor in England, while matters hold in England
as they do in modern times.''' That the bishop·maker in England should
ask Gascoigne why he was not a bishop, shows a simplicity which is
hardly conceivable. The allusion to a good tailor probably refers to the
tight-fitting dress of Henry’s time, on the indecency of which Gascoigne
comments (p. 145).

Henry was not indeed a mere cypher in his government. Had his
reign fallen on quieter days, his blameless lise and sincere piety might
have made him respected‚ and his kindness have humanized his people.
There are stories told of him which show that he had some force of
character, and that the people about him were anxious to keep him
in the dark, lest he shpuld undertake a reformation in society. Therev
