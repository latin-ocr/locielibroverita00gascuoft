xl INTRODUCTION.

issued to purvey minstrels, in order to give the King solace. On Dec. 12,
1455, York takes the precaution to which I have referred above, on the day
before the House rose for the Easter holidays, of getting his Protectorate
continued till he be discharged by Parliament. But on Feb. 25 he is
again exonerated from his office by the King himself. ‘After he< had
been appointed,' says Gascoigne (p. 204), ‘protector of the realm of
England by the Parliament in London permanently (futuris annis),
Margaret, Queen of England, with whom England got no goods, but the
loss of Maine and Anjou, which lands her husband, Henry the Sixth,
gave in perpetuity under his Great Seal to the Queen’s father, so
laboured by herself and other lords who were thought ill lords to
the realm, that the Duke gave up the authority which the whole Parlia-
ment had entrusted to him before, and then she carried off to her own
place, in the county of Chester, the King and the prince too, then two or
three years old; and she so ruled in the year 1456, that everything in the
realm was wrought by right or wrong, as many said, at the Queen’s will?
No Parliament sat between Feb. 1456, when York was dismissed, and
that held at Coventry in Nov. 1459, more than a year after Gascoigne's
death, when the whole Yorkist party was attainted.

Ι suspect that Gascoigne is in error when he states that the Queen
carried the King off to Cheshire. No public instrument is to be found in
Rymer between July 26, 1456 and Jan. 28, 1457. But the diocese of
Lichfield and Coventry is commonly called the Bishopric of Chester
during the fifteenth century, and Coventry was the stronghold of the
Lancastrian party, remaining faithful to that house long after its fortunes
seemed desperate. Several documents in the early part of 1457 bear the
King's teste at Coventry, and it is probable that during the summer and
autumn of 1456, when there are no instruments, he was at Coventry.

A few days after Gascoigne’s death, on March 24, 1458, Henry
issued the instrument of Pacification, which is transcribed in Whitehamp-
stede, under which the victors at St. Alban’s were to be bound to found
a chapel for the repose of those who had perished in the battle3 and that
both parties should acquiesce in the amity which the King strove to bring
about. I would fain see in this document the hand of some among the
better churchmen‚ who had, in this short calm before the storm, gained
access to the King.
