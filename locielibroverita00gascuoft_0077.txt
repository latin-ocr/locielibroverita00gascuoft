to a benefice with cure os souls, provided the unordained incumbent did
not undertake functions which none but a priest could sulfil. So, from the
Reformation to the Restoration and the Act of Uniformity‚ the canonries
in cathedrals‚ and even parochial churches, were occupied by persons
who had not received ordination of any kind, or at least had not received
ordination at the hands of an Anglican bishop. Keymer, Dean of Salis-
bury (p. 42), was one of those who, with the Bishop Beauchamp‚ the
successor of Aiscough, declared that the orthodox preachers were the a
promoters of sedition and insurrection against the ecclesiastics in 14 50.

The bishops owed their elevation to court intrigues, to simony, and
to bribes at the Papal court, the weakness of the government allowing the
laws to be broken with impunity. They were ignorant and illiterate‚
minus habentes, as Gascoigne says, bent on accumulating wealth, which
they spent in luxury, and on corrupting their own clergy whom they had
provided with benefices, and for whom they obtained from the Pope
licenses os non-residence. They welcomed (p. 41) the new doctrine of
Pecok‚ that bishops, as bishops, were not bound to preach. His brethren
said, ‘That excellent clerk and bishop will defend the practices of us
bishops? But the public judged very differently. N early everyone was
heard crying out, ‘Down with the bishops who grow rich, who wish to be
called lords, to be served on bended knee, who ride about with so many
and such fine horses, and will do nothing by way of preaching to save
men’s souls, for the bishops either do not know how to preach‚ or omit
the duty because they cannot preach unless to preach up those ill prac-
tices of which the bishops themselves are guilty, and do not preach good
works which the bishops do not do, but omit, and deride, and despise
such as do them? ‘ This: says my author, ‘ was common talk about the
bishops among clergy and laity, and day after day there was more and
more stir among the people, and they slew the bishop of Chichester,
Adam Moleyns‚ and the Bishop of Sarum, William Aiscough, and per-
secuted the Bishop of Chester (Le. Lichfield) one Booth‚ and the Bishop
of Norwich, Walter Lyhart, and many rectors and vicars in Kent, and
spoiled them at Sarum and Hungerford! Certainly if there were many
such bishops as that described in p. 167, the discontent was natural.
But (p. 119) he tells a more shocking story of the shamelessness of one
bishop, and the promise he made to a great sinner.
