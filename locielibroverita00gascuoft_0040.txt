The importance of salt in the economy of medieval life was very great.
From November to May, the mass of the English people lived on salted
provisions. On every fast day salted fish was the customary diet of
those who had anything more than bread to eat. The trade in salted
fish was a very important and lucrative employment. It was the princi-
pal means of preserving food in winter, and was the first condiment at all
times. It was in the period I write about entirely derived from solar
evaporation. A wet summer raised the price of salt far more than it
did that of wheat, and in ordinary times the price of salt away from the
sea closely corresponds, the above exception taken‚. to the price of wheat.
It could be procured abundantly and cheaply srom the salterns of
Western France. Long after the severance of G-uienne from England
was an accomplished fact, English monarchs, in their treaties with
France, demanded the free export of Gascon salt as a condition of
their negotiations. (Corps Diplomatique, Tom. iv. pars 1. 1527).

The wrath of the English, when they coupled the marriage of Mar-
garet of Anjou with the loss of Maine and Anjou, and the subsequent
loss of Normandy and Guienne, knew no boundS. ‘ That Queen Margaret‚’

come of the Queen's acts in the year of the Lord 1457, God knows.'
‘The King of England‚ Henry· the Sixth (p. 221) gave under his Great
Seal, Anjou and Maine, to the father of the Queen Margaret, and to
the heirs of Queen Margaret’s father, him who called himself King of
Sicily, and had neither obedience nor revenue from that kingdom,
which was subject to the then King of Arragon‚ and the aforesaid
Queen begged this gift from the King of England for her father by
the agency of the Duke of Suffolk and his wife, who had promised
their aid in the request ; and we are told that the Duke of Lorraine
swore to the Duke and Duchess (of Suffolk) that he would. bring about
a final peace between France and England‚ if the King of England
would cede the provinces, as he did by his seal, giving possession of
them by the hands of Adam de Moleyns, then Bishop of Chichester.
What the end will be (p. 204) God knows, who knows everything. May
His will be done, as in heaven so in earth.’ There were Englishmen,
