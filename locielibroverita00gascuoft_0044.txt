named dues. The fourth grant is that 20,000 archers, to be provided
rateably by the counties and towns, and paid sixpence a day for six
months 3 a schedule being annexed to the act, in which the proportion is
set forth to the extent of 13‚000‚ which the King declared to be sufficient.
On the announcement of these particulars, the King in person, and Kemp
the Chancellor, thanked the Commons for ‘their faithfulness, their con-
sideration, and their immense generosity.’ The House then adjourned for
the Easter holidays, and was ordered to meet again on April 25.

When they met again, Somerset, the Captain of Calais, laid his
accounts before them, and prayed a settlement of outstanding obliga-
tions, both for himself and his predecessor the Duke of Buckinghamss
The Commons direct that the arrears and the current charges should be
liquidated from the Customs‚ and the Speaker‚ Thorpe, on behalf of the
Commons, expedites the payment of the grants made on March 28, i.e.
Wednesday =before Easter, 1453. The King again thanked the Commons
warmly‚ and on July 2, remitting ‘the nobles to their recreations and de·
lights, the commons to the harvest‚’ prorogued Parliament to Nov. 12,
when it was to meet at Reading.

Ι have gone through these expedients at some length, partly because
they are an instructive illustration of medieval finance, partly because
they specify the resources which the country possessed at the time.
There was, the times considered, abundance of wealth in England at the
period immediately preceding the outbreak of civil war. The fifteenth
century was a period of singularly unbroken agricultural prosperity, of
plentiful harvests, of high wages, of accumulated opulence. Land which
a century before yielded in rent a return of ten per cent. on the purchase
money, now yielded five or less. F armers were gradually acquiring free-
hold estates and becoming yeomen, were the progenitors of the small
gentry who played so conspicuous a part in English History two cen-
turies later. In the universal passion for acquiring land commons were
enclosed, often by usurpation, and men of free estate became the pur-
chasers of copyhold, thus giving stability and a higher position to those
estates which the law books still affected to call base or precarious.
The tenants of these base fees resisted even the payment of customary
rents, and successfully demanding arbitration between themselves and
their lords, succeeded in reducing and permanently fixing their liabilities.
