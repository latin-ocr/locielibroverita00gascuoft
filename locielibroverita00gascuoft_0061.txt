diately made that grant of an income-tax to which I have already
referred. I discover in this tax on annuities and salaries, as well as
rents, a determination on the part of the Commons to exact something
from those very numerous pensions which had been granted from the
estates of the Crown‚ and which would certainly be exempted from any
act of resumption, however thorough, as may be seen to be the case in
all the acts of resumption which are recorded on the Rolls of Parliament
from the reign of Henry the Sixth to that of Henry the Eighth. After
supply, the Commons set to work on the two reforms which were most
distasteful to the Court and those juniores consiliarii of whom Gascoigne
speaks, the management of the royal household, and the resumption of
the King's hereditary revenue, now dwindled almost to nothing. The
mismanagement of domestic affairs was as conspicuous and irritating
as the mismanagement of foreign affairs was dishonourable and humi-
liating. The country was fleeced by purveyors, who took the farmer’s
corn and cattle, paying for them by tallies on a bankrupt exchequer‚
which was fifteen years of the ordinary revenue in debt. The army
abroad was demoralised. During the Easter recoes, the English lost the
battle of Fourmigny‚ and with it all hopes of retaining Normandy. Caen
was taken on July 1. Falaise and Cherbourg fell soon after, and Charles
of F rance was free to attack Guienne. Domoetic bankruptcy and foreign
disgrace, the penniless Queen, the loss of England's ancient possessions,
and the malpractices of the ministers and favourites were in every one's
mouth. The Court was determined to keep the Parliament together till
it became compliant; the Parliament was equally determined to reform
the finances and relieve the people from intolerable extortions. W'hile
this struggle was going on, news came which suspended all deliberations.
The Parliament and the King’s young counsellors were wrangling at
Leicaeten while the whole south of England was in sudden insurrection.
It must have been in the early summer of 1450 that Gascoigne
wrote the notes which may be found in pp. 219—20. ‘ There might,' he
sayS, ‘have been peace between the kingdoms of England and F rance,
with a large annual tribute to the English, if an English duke and
bishop had not refused the termS, when the council of either side was at
the altar.' ‘ The Jewish law ordained that men should take wives from
their own tribe and nation, that the inheritance should remain in families,
