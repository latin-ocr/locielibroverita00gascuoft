xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

was now thoroughly dissatisfied and discontented. The Duke of York
brought an action of trespass against Thorpe in the Exchequer Court, in
which alone, it appears, he could be prosecuted. Thorpe, it appears,
had a sufficient delay accorded to him in which to prepare his defence,
stood his trial, pleaded not guilty to a venire facias directed to the Sheriff
of Middlesex‚ and was convicted before a jury, which assessed the
damages at Α 1000, and the costs to the Crown at A 10. (See Rot. Parl.
v. 239, vi. 294). On Nov. 12, Parliament was again adjoumed till Feb.

11, when it was summoned to Reading. It was formally opened there, ’

and immediately adjourned to Feb. 14, at Westminster.

In the meanwhile, Somerset was committed to the Tower‚ Thorpe,
with another member—the bearer of an illustrious name, Walter Raleigh‚
knight for the shire of Devon———to the Fleet, and a commission had been ’
issued under the Great Seal, appointing Richard Duke of York lieu-
tenant of the kingdom, with power to hold Parliament, finish anddissolve
it. The Commons claimed the release of these two members on the day
of meeting‚ and York put in his reply on the day following. The case
of Thorpe is a leading and familiar one in the annals of Parliamentary
privilege, and has been frequently commented upon, sometimes as
illustrating the position taken by James the First, that the privilege of
Parliament was a precarious concession of the Crown, which could be
resumed at pleasure3 sometimes as a proof that this particular Parliament
was cowed, sometimes as an illustration ‘of the iniquity of the times.' But
if the averment of York‚ in his reply of Feb. 15, be correct, Thorpe had
been legally convicted, in the proper court, and with all deference to his
function as one of the officers of the Exchequer, of a serious trespass,
accompanied by a gross breach of the peace. There appears to be
no informality in the proceedings and no haste, for it is impossible to
believe that the Duke could have inserted a reply on the Roll of Parlia-
ment, the particulars of which, if false, could have easily been refuted by
a recent record of judgment, enrolling a debt due to the Crown. Besides
a trespass vi et armis is a breach of the peace, and the privilege of
Parliament did not protect a member who was guilty of a breach of the
peace. In their changed mood too, the Commons would not be unwilling
to be rid of a partisan Speaker, whose authority and initiative was at that
time so great in their House. That their temper was changed is shown
