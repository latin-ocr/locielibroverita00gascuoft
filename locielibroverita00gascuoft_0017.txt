PREFACE. vii

Veritatum' (pp. 12, 129), is a collection of passages ,illustrating
or explaining a number of words, in a rude alphabetical order,
from ‘ Absolucio’ to ‘Virginitas’ Occasionally an article is
inserted out of its place. SometimeS, as in the largest ex-
tract which 1 have made, the position of the passage is due
to the leading word in the heading, i.e. ‘Flumina' (p. 53). In
the vast majority of cases, the interpretation or comment which
the author makes is founded on, or confirmed by, a quotation
from some one of the Latin fathers, especially SS. Jerome.
Augustine, and Gregory, and the English divine, Grosteste.
But the author quotes a very large number of authorities,
and must have been possessed, as we know to be the fact
from other evidence, of a very considerable library for the
timeS. During his lifetime he gave many books to Oriel,
Balliol, Lineoln‚ and Durham Colleges.

Ι have read the Manuscript through; but, except to one
who might desire to know what were the studies of a fifteenth
century divine, there is little to interest any reader in the
merely theologica] part of the work. The authors with whom
Gascoigne was familiar have not 'been lost. The books
which he studied are, many of them, still in existence. The
volume from which Ι have quoted the extract which comes
last in the present work, and is represented in facsimile on
the title-page, once belonged to Grosteste, and is full of that
prelate's marginal notes, lt subsequently became Gascoigne’s
property, and was given by him, as an entry on the first
page in his own hand informs us, to Durham College, After
the Reformation and the suppression of Durham, now the site
of Trinity College, it came into the possession of a member
of Gloucester Hau, who gave it to the Bodleian Library.
