, up to delights‚ and lords have bishoprics and great offices in the church
conferred on them before they are vacant, and they give their duties to
others and take no share in them’ (he is probably thinking of George
Nevil’s appointment when under age to the bishopric of Exeter, and the
license which the Pope gave him to -enjoy the temporalities of the see
(p. 16) on the condition that his consecration was postponed till he was
27 years old), ‘while all discipline over· individuals is destroyed by
inhibitions and appeals to the Court of Arches in L0·nd0n.' Patrons
indeed must be protected against intrigue‚ but the defence of their rights
is the destruction of church discipline. He gives an illustration (p. 32) of
the manner in which this injury was effected.

Richard Praty‚ bishop of Chichester‚ 1430-45‚ the immediate pre-
decessor of De Moleyns, was a member of Oriel College‚ and therefore
probably an acquaintance of Gascoigne. He had excommunicated and
deprived a certain vicar of infamous reputation and naughty life. The
vicar, after worrying the bishop a long time in the court of Arches‚
demanded that the bishop‚ under severe penalties should absolve him
from the sentence of excommunication which had been pronounced, on
the ground that Pope Eugenius had granted any competent priest the
power of absolving all who belonged to the brotherhood of the house of
St. Anthony in London. But the bishop declined to revoke his sentence,
deprived the vicar of his benefice, and notwithstanding the entreaties of
the Earl of Arundel and others, refused to restore him, but thrust him
from his diocese like a scabbed sheep. ‘This letter,' said the bishop‚
‘which you say has been granted by the Pope, cuts away all power
bestowed by the Lord on bishops, because it follows from this grant, that
every culprit must be absolved by the bishop, will he, or will he not, or
the bishop must risk offending the Pope, and thus any bishop will absolve
the most profligate wretch on the mere shewing of a papal bull, or what-
ever other means are employed for your absolution before God. Besides,’
he continued, ‘it does not follow that I ought to absolve you, because
you show the bull of a Pope who can err and be misled. Ι know that in
the Roman court, when the Pope has agreed to issue a bull in response to
the prayer of a petition‚ the Pope’s attendants, and 'chamberlains, and
courtiers, drunk with the venom of covetousness‚ draw up the bulls,
renlarging or shortening the clauseS, putting in what the Pope never knew
