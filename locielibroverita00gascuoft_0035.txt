INTRODUCTION. xxv

But its uses as a financial instrument were even more remarkable.
It is the only produce which I have been able to find, in the long range
of my enquiries into the history of finance, which was, in the middle
ageS, so absolute a necessity and so absolute a monopoly that an export
duty could be levied on it, without diminishing the demand for it, in the
foreign market. Financiers have always desired to find some product
on which they could levy such a tax as the foreign consumet would
be constrained to pay. Except in the case of English wool, from the
thirteenth to the end of the sixteenth century, the search has been
as profitless and as disappointing as that for the philosopher's stone
or the quadrature of the circle. But during the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries, English wool satisfied every condition of that financial
problem which is seeking to impose an import duty that is to be paid
by the consumet. It was a necessity. There was no substitute for
it. It could hardly be economised. There was no other source of
supply. The hundred years’ war was carried on out of the taxation
of wool, and the tax was paid by those upon whom war was made.
There is a remarkable petition in the rolls of Parliament under the year
1454 (32 Henry VI) in which the various qualities of English wool are
specified. They are forty-four in number, and differ in value from the
highest, 260 shillings the sack, the price os Hereford produce in the
neighbourhood of Leominster, to 50 shillings the sack, at which the
worth of Sussex wool is fixed. These, beyond question, are the rates
at which the brands of English produce were sold in the Flemish
markets. English wool again was the means by which the Roman
Court was enabled to extract the ,enormous revenues which it gained
from England in the pre—reformation period. Gascoigne (p. 52) com-
plains of the manner in which England was robbed by the agency of
the Lombard exchangers. Their operations were carried on by com-
mercial instruments based on English wool and Flemish eloth.

While the passions, roused by successful war and by the reverses of
war, were being called into activity‚ while the strife abroad was languishing,
but was to be succeeded by a fierc'er strife at horne, there was one
figure, the chief person in English life, whom every one revered, whom
no one consulted, and whom every one who could do so, pillaged.
To the English of the fifteenth century the son of the great warrior,
