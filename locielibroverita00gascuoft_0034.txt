xxiv INTRODUCTION.

August, 143 5, was great cause of pride in English prowess, though it fore-
shadowed Burgundyâ€™s desertion. But the occupation of Normandy was
hardly of less importance. If N ormandy were in the hands of England,
she could prevent piracy or privateering in the numerous ports of that
duchy, and could keep in check the corsairs of Brittany, who were for
many a year after that time the pests of the coasting trade. Long after
the discovery of the New World, and that of the Cape passage, had made
the ancient routes of commerce less important, the retenti-on of Calais
was supposed to be the key to England's maritime power, and a bridle
on the Netherlands and on France. A century after Calais was lost,
Cromwell consulted that old instinct of England which desired a fortified
port on the French and Flemish frontier, by the seizure and fortification
of Dunkirk, the sale of which to Louis the F ourteenth was conceived to
be a political crime ancl a political blunder of the gravest kind.

The mastery over the narrow seas was not only a political security,
but in the opinion of the age, a mercantile necessity. The principal
articles of English exportation at the time were wool and hides. The
wool trade was the chief source of English wealth, and almost the only
means by which England could acquire possession of foreign productS.
It may seem strange to us now, but England was almost the only
European country from which this absolute necessary of life, second only
to food, ,could be procured. A small quantity, and that, as we are told, of
a quality which was unworkable except after mixing with English pro-
duce, was obtained by a tedious sea voyage from Spain. England in
the fifteenth century had the monopoly of the wool market to a greater
extent than even the United States had of cotton before the outbreak
of the war between the slave-owners and the Commonwealth of the
States. The free export of wool from England meant that the looms
of Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp, and a hundred other thriving F lemish
towns, should go on merrily, that employment should be abundant, that
profits should accumulate, that wealth should be diffused. Restraints
upon this article meant the decay of industry, discontent, and serious
outbreaks. The basis of those negotiations with the Low Countries,
which began with Philip Van Arteveldt, and were best illustrated, in the

days of Henry the Seventh, by the success of the Intercursus Magnus,
was English wool, its, free or restrained export.
