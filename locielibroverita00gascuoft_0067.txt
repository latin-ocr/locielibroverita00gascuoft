memory will be accursed sor ever,’ describes as ‘indignus episcopus Ces-
triae' (p. 40); and again (p. 52), as ‘ an illiterate man, of bad character,
who had never taken a degree, but had been a common lawyer, thrust
into his see by a papal provision obtained from Pope Nicholas V by
the King's license, and now Margaret’s chancellor‚’ John sutton, Lord
Dudley, and the abbot of St.Peter's, Gloucester. Most of the rest are
officers of the household, and the petition further demands that such
persons among them as hold any office at court shall be discharged of it,
and receive no wages from Dec. 1.

The King replied by his Chancellor, Stafford, who, if Gascoigne is to
be trusted (p. 231), was the most profligate churchman of the day, that
he had often declared to his Parliament that it was his intention to have
none but virtuous persons about him, and that he is not informed of any
cause why he should dispense with the services of the persons named in
the petition. But he is willing that, with the exception of the lords and
a very few others, the rest should absent themselves from the court for
a year, during which time any one who wills may have an opportunity of
alleging reasons in favour of a longer banishment from his presence. The
King adds, however, that he reserves the right of using all his subjects
without exception, in case he takes the field against his rebels and
enemies, i. e. reformers of the type of Cade‚ and the constant enemy in

dismissal, not only of the household, but of the King's cousin and prin-
cipal adviser, of the widow of Suffolk, who was about the person of the
Queen‚ and of Booth, the Queen's principal minister, the mildness of the
answer seems to measure the alarm of the court. Next year, however,
to Gascoigne’s infinite disgust, this ignorant lawyer and unworthy bishop
is promoted to the see of York. It was more provoking and more scan-
dalous than the promotion of Sibthorp and Mainwaring by Charles Ι.

The Parliament reenacted the Act of Resumption, totidem verbis,
and attainted Cade, not for the original offence‚ but for treasons alleged
to be committed by him from the 8th to the 11th of July inclusive, in
Southwark‚ Dartford, and Rochester. But not content with branding
the memory of the King's rebel, it sought to do the same by the public
enemy, Suffolk. The Commons petition the King that as Suffolk made
no valid and sufficient answer to the charges brought against him, a
