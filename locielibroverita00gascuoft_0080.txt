lxx INTRODUCTION.

nor granted, nor could grant acceptably in the sight of God, and so,' said
the bishop, ‘I will not act according to your bull, for Ι believe that the
Pope never gave it in words, and Ι know that he cannot grant it in fact,
for the power given him by Christ is that-he should bind what man may
rightly bind, and bind and loose without man’s consent any human act,
but only as it accords with the increase of Godfs worship and the true
safety of souls. No man of sane mind could accept your contention,
that any one who has a papal license to the effect, shall be absolved
by any competent priest.'

But the most striking illustration of the bishop in Gascoigne’s age is
to be found in a story which he tells of De la Bere, Bishop of St. David’s
(p. 35). This man had been Henry's almoner, had been made Dean of
Wells by papal provision (p. 200), and had caused infinite scandal by the
appointment. To put an end to the scandal, the same agency of a
papal provision was brought into operation, and Dela Bere was made
Bishop of St. David's. ‘About the years 1452 and 1453, the rectors,
vicars, and priests of Wales, who had concubines with them in their

by your authority, that we may never have opportunity os sinning with
them, and these concubines may never have an opportunity of sinning
by cohabiting with us.” And that bishop of detestable memory’ (he
outlived Gascoigne) ‘answered them, “I will not grant that your con-
cubines be separated from you or your homes, or be compelled to leave
them, for in that case, I your bishop should yearly lose 400 marks,
which I receive yearly in my diocese for the priests' concubines, for'
1 get yearly a noble or more from each of many priests for his con-
cubine, and the sum which comes to my purse makes annually 400
marks, and Ι will not have them separated from you.'' And the priests
said to that Bishop of Saint David's in Wales, “ O lord bishop, we wish
to have them separated from us, and these concubines will not be se-
