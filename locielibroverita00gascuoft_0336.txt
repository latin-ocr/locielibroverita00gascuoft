234 NOTES.

PAGE

129. It is from this passage that 1 have taken the title of the book.

130. Gascoigne is alluding to De la Bere, Bishop of St. David’s.

141. The passage ‘ideo vocatur Wiclyffe nequam rita, memoriae ter dampnatae‚’
fairly puzzled me, and all the antiquaries to whom I showed it. At last I
put the words before Mr. Thompson, of the MSS. department, British Museum,
who suggested, after a few minutes‚ that the reading should be ‘nequam
vita‚’ and that the words were a pun on Wikliff's name. The emendation
is one os those happy conjectures, which instantly approve themselves, and
are seen to be perfectly conclusive. It may be observed that Knyghton
similarly jests on Wikliff’s name, saying that it would be more properly
‘Wicked belief!

168. For ‘N aturis apostolorum’ read ‘N aturis apum.'

175. I do not find Dighton as a parish at the present time.

193. The passage in spaced type is underlined and written in a larger hand in
the MS.

201. Gascoigne is referring to himself.

202. The sister referred to is probably that sister of the author who carried the
estate of Hunslet to a branch of the Westmoreland Neviles‚ through whom
it descended till, after the rebellion of the Northern Earls‚ it was forfeited.

Ib. This is the source of the statement (copied by Hearne, and commented on by
many historians) as to the prodigious number of studentsgat Oxford in the
fourteenth century.

204. 1 have no idea what the scribe intended by ‘Malkus.' The word is written
over ‘ Cenomanniam.⁷

218. The burning of Pecok⁷s books at Oxford (in the latter part of his account
Gascoigne generally calls him ‘Pacok‚' probably in contempt) on Dec. 17,
1457, is the latest fact noted in the Liber Veritatum.

229. Lingard doubts whether Scrope really approved of the remonstrance printed
here. The text however shows that he did, and that it is difficult to aequit
the archbishop of a design of deposing Henry.

2 32. The last passage will be found in facsimile at the title page.

*** It is possible that ‘quum' has been printed for ‘quando' a few times. The
word is constantly written ‘qu.' But I am informed that this should always

be read as ‘quando.’
