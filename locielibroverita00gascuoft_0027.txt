INTRODUCTION.

THOMAS GASCOIGNE, from whose ‘Liber Veritatum,' or ‘Dictio-
narium Theologicum,’ the extracts contained in the following pages
have been collected, was the eldest or only son of Richard and Beatrice
Gascoigne (p. 31), and was born at their manor of Hunslet in 1403
(p. 192). Hunslet was a hamlet then near, and now part of, the town
of Leeds. It appears that Gascoigne had two sisters, one who became
Lady Ros (p. 229), another who was married to a cadet of the house of
Nevile, Lord Westmoreland (p. 202), and carried the estate into that
family. The manor os Hunslet remained in this branch of the Neviles
till the head of the family joined the insurrection of the Northern
Earls in 1569, when the estate was forfeited to the crown.

There is a constant tradition that Richard Gascoigne was brother
of the famous chief justice who refused to try Archbishop Scrope on
a charge of troeson3 and, according to a less credible story, having
been insulted on the bench by Henry of Monmouth, committed the
wild Prince of Wales to prison. My author makes no allusion to such
a relationship‚ though it seems as if the passage in the account of
Scrope's execution, in which the answer of the chief justice to the
king's request that he should try Scrope for treason is given, must
have been supplied by the speaker to the writer. The name Gascoigne
is frequent among the Yorkshire families of the fifteenth century.

Gascoigne's father must have died when he was young, as he says
that he lived on his patrimony from his youth (p. 196). He does
not tell us in what year he came to Oxford3 but as he graduated
doctor of divinity in 1434, and the statutes of the University prescribed
that eleven years should intervene between the status of the regent
master and admission to the doctor's degree, he must have taken the
earlier degree in 1423, and as the master’s degree was reached seven
years after matriculation, he must have commenced his residence in
