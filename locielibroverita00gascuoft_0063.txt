common weaL’ and ‘spared not to speak that the Captain’s cause was
profitable to the Commonwealth? Gascoigne tells us (p. 190) that while
the Commons were wrangling with the King’s young counsellors at
Leicester, and the young counsellors were trying to browbeat the
Gemmeus, and ⁸ before the settlement of many articles in that Parliament³
the commons os Kent rose under their Captain John Cade, who was
descended from a base-born Roger Mortimer, and that this captain, after
pardon granted to him and his by the King‚ was mortally wounded by
the troeson os his servant, and brought dead to London in July, 145o.’

The fifteen articles contained in the complaint of the commons of
Kent are well known. They do not, however, occur in the Rolls of Par-
liament. They are, speaking generally, identical with those grievances
of which the Commons complained, which they had been striving, both
in London and Leicester‚ to redress. The battle of Sevenoaks was
followed by the occupation of Southwark, the entry into London, the
behoeding os Lord Fiennes and his son-in-law, Cromer, the sheriff of
Kent‚ and the battle os London Bridge. This fight was indecisive, and
the King‚ taking advantage of the opportunity, issued a pardon. The
expedient had the usual effect, and the insurgents dispersed. Cade, after
· taking his goods to Rochester‚ and having attempted unsuccessfully to
seize Queenborough Castle, fled to Lewes, where he was slain‚ and the in-
surrection was at an end. How grave it was is to be seen in the attainder
of Cade, and in the number of persons who sor some years afterwards
were charged with complicity in the outbreak. Among these was Sir W’m.
Oldhall‚ Speaker of the Commons in the Parliament os Nov. 1450, who
was outlawed in 1453, sor having been a favourer os Cade. Cade himself
prosessed to believe that the King’s pardon was invalid unless it were
affirmed by Parliament.

Other disturbances occurred simultaneously with the Kentish in-
surrection. In narrating an atrocious crime committed near N ewbury‚
Gascoigne (p. 139) mentions that it took place during an insurrection in
these districts. Similar riots occurred in Devon.

The courtly bishops and the King's counsellors accused the ortho-
dox preachers os fomenting these disturbances in consequence of the
sermons which they preached against the vices of the age. ‘The
preachers of the Word of God,' says Gascoigne (p. 188), ‘the most
