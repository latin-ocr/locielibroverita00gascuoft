xii PREFACE.

to be very eminent by his contemporaries, I ought, however,
to infer that many of the obscurities are solecisms of the text
and due to the copyists. ⁷

My reader will find the same story told over and ovet
again, but almost always with some additions. I have some<
times thought that Gascoigne did not like to tell all the facts
at once, but preferred to say what he wished piecemeal, from

condemned him was, as we shall see, immediately connected with
Pecok's letter to the Lord Mayor of London‚ Cannyng.

The longest extract which I have printed, the commentary
