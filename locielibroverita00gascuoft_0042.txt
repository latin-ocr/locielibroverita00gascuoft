and solid government of the realm of England internally, and its
external defence.

The remarkable financial expedients adopted at the crisis were
undoubtedly the work of the Speaker. He had been member for
Ludgershall in the Parliament of 1450, and was now returned for EsseX.
In the fifteenth century, the Speaker was an infinitely more important
officer of the House than the more familiar machinery of Parliament has

left him now. He waS, in fact, the agent between the Commons and the ’

Crown, who presented petitions and announced grants. Thorpe had
now a rare opportunity for aiding the Crown by new financial expe-
dients, for the news of a revival of loyalty in Guienne gave hopes to the
administration‚ which had not recovered from the prosecution‚ the
banishment‚ and the death of Suffolk‚ from the ill-disguised feuds of
the great nobles, and from the unpopularity of somerset. Thorpe was
therefore able to recommend a scheme for raising supplies before a sym-
pathising house, and to venture on bold expedients for the relies of the
exchequer and the conduct of the war.

On March 28, 1453, Thorpe, in modern phrase, brought forward
his budget. It consisted of four parts—a property-taX‚ with certain
exception53 an increase in the customs’ duty3 a licence duty3 and
a special fund, distributed over the counties and towns rateably, ac-
cording to their wealth, for the maintenance of an army of 20,000
archers (afterwards reduced to 13‚ooo), during six months, at the pay
of sixpence a day during service, the men to be equipped, but all
further charges, as it appears, to be defrayed from the exchequer. The
last item was so nicely distributed that, the men to each county and
town being apportioned, the actual number so provided is 12,999. The
distribution of the tax may be found in the rolls of Parliament, and
is one of the few documents preserved in the national archives which
instruct us as to the distribution of wealth in England during the middle
ages. There is no doubt that this budget must have been carefully
prepared during the interval in which T'albot accepted the lieutenancy
of Guienne and the summons to a Parliament.

In 1450 the House os Commons—in which the reforming party
was hostile to Suffolk and the Court, and friendly to the admission
os the Duke of York to the councils of the King—had granted an extra-
