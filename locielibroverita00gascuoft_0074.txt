consideration, marriages between very near kin. It frequently, for in-
stance, sanctioned a marriage between uncle and niece in the royal house
of Portugal. Beyond the doctrine that the action of the Pope must be
in accordance with the law of God, Ι do not find that Gascoigne recog-
nises any control over the Pope in matters of saith and doctrine. Stin
his opinions on indulgences, and his statement that the Pope is liable to
err in matters of fact, is a large qualification.

But, whatever may be his reverence sor the Pope’s authority, and
however large he considers the Pope’s powers of government, especially
over the monastic orders, he has no respect whatever for the Pope‘s court
and cardinals. ‘The Pope’ he says (p. 129), ‘is frequently constrained
by the excessive importunity of kings, lords, and officers, of cardinals and
referendaries, to grant much which he does not judge either by Holy
Scripture or common reason ought to be granted, and what is not in

that Prosper should have two English rectories in commendam worth
a hundred poundS‚ and yet this Prosper always went up to the English
who might be in the Roman court, saying, ‘You English, give me back
my benefice.’ ‘This cardinal was appointed’ says Gascoigne, ‘by his
uncle when he was only eighteen years old. Ι have heard,' he says
(p. 196), ‘that lately, in the time of a pope who died a few years ago—he
probably means Eugenius--the Pope, worn out by the importunities and
entreaties of those who profferred their petitions and expectant favours
(i.e. provisions) written out in deeds, has said, “Since you tease and harass
me so, let what you want be done in the devil’s name‚” and so a deed was
