live on our goods, will we or not, and therefore because we do not dare
to drive them out, through sear. of their friends, who encourage them
in living in our homes, we therefore pray, lord bishop, that they be
separated from us and our homes by your means.'' And the bishop
told them, “I will not compel them to leave you, sor then Ι, your
bishop, should lose much money yearly.’' Now that Bishop De la Bere
was the man who was thrust upon the church of wells, by provision
of Nicholas V against the will of the chapter, but he was not installed
because he feared a violent death there, and afterwards he was scan-
dalously sent by provision to the bishopric of St. David's, because the
king of England‚ Henry VI, who afterwards went out of his mind, gave
him a license to accept a papal provision for both dignitieS.'

The story which Gascoigne tells is perhaps a little coloured, at least
as regards the unanimous and persistent appeal of the clergy. It points
of course to the existence of a married clergy in South WVales, and to
the fact that the marriage of priests was very common in the prin-
cipality. This, Ι believe, is well known. It is probable that there
might have been some ascetic movement in De la Bere’s diocese which
brought about a numerous deputation to the bishop, and that many
among the clergy may have wished, on religious grounds, to reform their
practices3 some, as their prayer seems to hint, from avarice‚ and from
a desire to repudiate their bargain. The mention of the sear felt sor
the friends of the women clearly implies that the connexion was re-
cognized. But I see no reason to doubt that the recorded answer of
the bishop is substantially accurate.

There was, however, another grievance in the policy of the English
bishops‚ of which Gascoigne often complains. The hierarchy‚ as is well
known, was bitterly attacked by the poor priests of Wiklif's movement‚
and by their successors the Lollard Gospellers. It was thought, and
with reason, that the insurgents under Tyler and Littlestreet were
stimulated to their insurrection by the Wikliffite preachers; and in
particular, it is certain that Oxford was a stronghold of the party
which favoured Church reform. Henry IV, anxious to conciliate all
parties, inserted in the Roll of Parliament of his second year (the Par-
liament sat srom jan. 20 to March 10, 1401) a statute giving the effect
of law to a ‘ provincial constitution' (p. 34), carried previously by
