xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

committee of the Lords to wait on the King at Windsor, and to insorm'
themselves as to the state of his mind. It appears clearly to me that the·
Peers had no conception of the extent of the King’s derangernent. With
considerate delicacy they did not appoint York as one of their number.
The committee consisted os twelve persons, Waynflete Bishop of Win-
chester‚ Bourchier Bishop of· Ely, who was soon Kemp’s successor in the
primacy, and Bowles Bishop of Litchfield ; the Earls of Warwick, Oxford,
and Shrewsbury‚ Viscounts Beaumont and Bourchier; the Prior of St.
john, and Lords Falconbridge, Dudley, and Stanton.

The report which these personages gave of the Kingrs condition is
well known. They found that his physical powers were almost gone, and
that his mind was entirely gone. They made their report on the 25th of
March. On the 27th York was appointed Protector and Defensor Regni,
the term implying such powers as had been conferred during Henry's
nonage on Humphrey Duke of GIoucester. The instrument provided
that York should hold office till he was superseded by the King‚ or till
the prince, now about five months old, should come to years of discretion.

known as father of the Earl of Warwick, as the staunchest partisan of
York, as included in the attainder of Coventry, and as sharing his fate
at Wakefield. The Archbishopric was given to Bourchier, brother of
Viscount Bourchier, who in later times was also a Yorkist. Bourchier
remained Archbishop of Canterbury for thirty-four yearS‚ and seems to
have acquiesced in all the changes of the succession from the downfall of
Henry the Sixth to the accession of Henry the Seventh. The govern-
ment of Calais was taken by the Duke os York, and Somerset remained
in the Tower. Α

At Christmas, Henry recovered his physical and mental health as* “
completely, it appears, as he lost thern, released Somerset, superseded
York, and took Calais into his own hands. It appears from Gascoigne
(p. 203) that Somerset had been committed to the Tower by the Council,
and that after his ‘ illegal release, the Duke os York wrote to the King by
the hands of Wulfet his confessor, while he was residing at St. Alban’s,
