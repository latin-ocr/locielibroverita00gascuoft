Lancaster, during the time of the King’s insanity. Between the death
of Gloucester and the birth of Edward, the possible rivals for the throne,
should it become vacant, were the niece of the Duke of Somcrset, whose
family, it appears, had been legitimated without reservation, the nearest
representative of the house of Lancaster‚ and the Duke of York, who
had assuredly never forgotten his superior claim to the throne, and was
looked on by all parties as first prince of the blood.

The episode of Joan of Arc was vexatious, and led to the raising
of the siege of Orleans, and the occupatiori of Rheims. But the English
held possession of Paris till April, 1436, and of Normandy and Guienne
sor a much longer period. But in fact, no army os English, however
numerous and however well appointed, could have kept F rance in sub-
jection. It would have been necessary to garrison every town with
English troops, at least in other than the hereditary dominions of the
Plantagenet kings‚ and to have secured the constant services of a strong
ally on the mainland. For a time the English had such an ally in
the Duke of Burgundy. But when the alliance was broken by the raid
on Calais, and the death of Bedford‚ the hope of occupying F rance was
gone, and the utmost which the exertions of the English could expect
was the retention of Normandy and Guienne, the connecting link of
which was Anjou and Maine.

The possession of Normandy waS‚ according to the policy of Eng-
land in the fifteenth century, and indeed for a long time afterwards,
of signal importance. It enabled the English navy to keep the mastery
of the narrow seas, and the control over those seas was equivalent to
the control of all commerce by sea. This is shown with great clear-
ness and detail in that remarkable political tract, published in the
Rolls’ Series, among other political songs and ballads of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, by the late Mr. Wright, under the title of
‘A Libel of English Policy.' The whole mercantile marine of Europe
was engaged in coasting along France to the Low Countries, with the
exception os than—already almost lost, owing to the decline of the Greek
empne—which passed up the Danube, and that which was carried on the
highway of the Rhine. The occupation os two strongly fortified ports
at the narrowest part of the Channel, at Dover and Calais, was the key
of the position, and the repulse of the Flemings from before Calais, in
