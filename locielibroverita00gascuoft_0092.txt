dispensations and licenses. It will be seen that these‘heads include
nearly all the ground which they covered, who wished to reform the
church without altering or tampering with its doctrine, as for instance
the authors of the ‘ Centum gravamina.’ It is not too much to say that
there is the full dawn of the Reformation in Gascoigne's criticisms on
his own times. .

Gascoigne says but little about the heretics of his own age, the ob-
scure Lollard preachers or gospellers, whose calling was so dangerous.
The Wikliffites, he says, abused the miracles of the saints, because they
do none themselves, just as Mahomet did in his day, but even here he
speaks in the past tense. In p. 117, under the head Haeretz'cus, he
gives the principal characteristics of heresy, the chief of which is the
preference of human reason to revelation. He makes the time-honoured
charge against heretics, that their morals are licentious, but allows that
they are of acute perception and active genius. No one, he says, can
be the author of a heresy unless he be a man of active genius, though
he adds that they are apt to take their place among the spineta of
Aristotle and Chrysippus, whose dicta they allow for gospel.

But he has a good deal to say about Wiklif, the Bohemian schism of
Huss, Jerome of Prague, the Bohemian students at Oxford, and particu-
larly about Peter Payne, or Clerk‚ who went off to Bohemia with Wiklif’s
books, and persuaded the Bohemians that every one in Oxford was
like—minded with the heresiarch‚ except certain friars, fortifying this state-
ment by a document signed with the University seal, which seal he had
purloined for the purpose. He says (p. 116) in his account of Wiklif that
the University of Oxford, in 1410, condemned more than two hundred of
his conclusions and burnt his books at Carfax‚ in the presence of the
chancellor, Thomas de Prestbury, abbot of Shrewsbury. He also gives
some account of the proceedings of the Council of Constance against
Huss and Jerome of Prague, which he got from a conversation with
Spofforth, bishop of Hereford (p. 10), who was present at the execution,
and after resigning his bishopric retired to St. Mary's Abbey in York.
The cause, he tells uS, of the Bohemian schism was the intolerable scandal
which was given by the corruptions of the Bohemian church, the prelates
and dignitaries of which were discreditable and notorious, and he states
that the University of Prague gave the Pope fair warning that is a sharp
