and the tribes be not intermixed, but remain as they were separated
by God, from whence it is plainly expedient, and preventive of many
evils, that kings and great lords should take to themselves wives from
the same realm‚ that the inheritance may remain to the people of the
same realm, and nations be not intermixed‚ but remain as God has
divided them, viZ. by different seas, sometimes by deserts, and by moun-

The news of Cade's revolt struck terror everywhere, most of all into
the hearts of those time-serving, greedy‚ and corrupt bishops who hung

Kent, or the captain of the commons, as he was called, was a very dif-
ferent person in the eyes of those who witnessed the outbreak. ‘ He was‚’
we are told, ‘a young man of goodly stature, and right pregnant of wit.'
After the battle of Sevenoaks, when he encamped on Blackheath, and
the King sent Stafsord‚ the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Duke of
Buckingham to confer with him, they found him ‘sober in talk, wise in
reasoning, arrogant in heart, and stiff-in opinion.' Men would not fight-
against him, for they said that he and his followers ‘laboured for the
